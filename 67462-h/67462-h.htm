named, and the symbol &gt; followed by a date, to indicate an uncertain
date not later than that named. Thus 1903 &lt;&gt; 23 would indicate the
composition date of any part of this book. I have sometimes placed the
date of a play in italics, where it was desirable to indicate the date
of production rather than publication.</p>

<p>[<i>Bibliographical Note.</i>&mdash;Of the dissertations named in the
<i>note</i> to ch. xviii, T. S. Graves, <i>The Court and the
London Theatres</i> (1913), is perhaps the most valuable for
the subject of the present chapter, which was mainly written
before it reached me. A general account of the Italian drama of
the Renaissance is in W. Creizenach, <i>Geschichte des neueren
Dramas</i>, vol. ii (1901). Full details for Ferrara and Mantua
are given by A. D’Ancona, <i>Origini del Teatro Italiano</i>
(1891), of which App. II is a special study of <i>Il Teatro
Mantovano nel secolo xvi</i>. F. Neri, <i>La Tragedia italiana
del Cinquecento</i> (1904), E. Gardner, <i>Dukes and Poets
at Ferrara</i> (1904), and <i>The King of Court Poets</i>
(1906), W. Smith, <i>The Commedia dell’ Arte</i> (1912), are
also useful. Special works on staging are E. Flechsig, <i>Die
Dekorationen der modernen Bühne in Italien</i> (1894), and G.
Ferrari, <i>La Scenografia</i> (1902). The Terence engravings
are described by M. Herrmann, <i>Forschungen zur deutschen
Theatergeschichte des Mittelalters und der Renaissance</i>
(1914). Of contemporary Italian treatises, the unprinted
<i>Spectacula</i> of Pellegrino Prisciano is in <i>Cod.
Est. lat.</i> d. x. 1, 6 (cf. G. Bertoni, <i>La Biblioteca
Estense</i>, 13), and of L. de Sommi’s <i>Dialoghi in materia
di rappresentazione scenica</i> (c. 1565) a part only is in
L. Rasi, <i>I Comici italiani</i> (1897), i. 107. The first
complete edition of S. Serlio, <i>Architettura</i> (1551),
contains Bk. ii, on <i>Perspettiva</i>; the English translation
was published by R. Peake (1611); extracts are in App. G; a
biography is L. Charvet, <i>Sébastien Serlio</i> (1869). Later
are L. Sirigatti, <i>La pratica di prospettiva</i> (1596),
A. Ingegneri, <i>Della poesia rappresentativa e del modo di
rappresentare le favole sceniche</i> (1598), and N. Sabbatini,
<i>Pratica di fabricar scene e macchine ne’ Teatri</i> (1638).</p>

<p>For France, E. Rigal, <i>Le Théâtre de la Renaissance</i>
and <i>Le Théâtre au xvii<sup>e</sup> siècle avant Corneille</i>, both
in L. Petit de Julleville, <i>Hist. de la Langue et de la
Litt. Françaises</i> (1897), iii. 261, iv. 186, and the same
writer’s <i>Le Théâtre Français avant la Période Classique</i>
(1901), may be supplemented by a series of studies in <i>Revue
d’Histoire Littéraire de la France</i>&mdash;P. Toldo, <i>La Comédie
Française de la Renaissance</i> (1897–1900, iv. 336; v. 220,
554; vi. 571; vii. 263), G. Lanson, <i>Études sur les Origines
de la Tragédie Classique en France</i> (1903, x. 177, 413) and
<i>L’Idée de la Tragédie en France avant Jodelle</i> (1904,
xi. 541), E. Rigal, <i>La Mise en Scène dans les Tragédies
du xvi<sup>e</sup> siècle</i> (1905, xii. 1, 203), J. Haraszti, <i>La
Comédie Française de la Renaissance et la Scène</i> (1909, xvi.
285); also G. Lanson, <i>Note sur un Passage de Vitruve</i>, in
<i>Revue de la Renaissance</i> (1904), 72. Less important is E.
Lintilhac, <i>Hist. Générale du Théâtre en France</i> (1904–9,
in progress). G. Bapst, <i>Essai sur l’Histoire du Théâtre</i>
(1893), and D. C. Stuart, <i>Stage Decoration and the Unity of
Place in France in the Seventeenth Century</i> (1913, <i>M.
P.</i> x. 393), deal with staging, for which the chief material
is E. Dacier, <i>La Mise en Scène à Paris au xvii<sup>e</sup> siècle:
Mémoire de L. Mahelot et M. Laurent</i> in <i>Mémoires de la
Soc. de l’Hist. de Paris et de l’Ile-de-France</i>, xxviii
(1901), 105. An edition by H. C. Lancaster (1920) adds Mahelot’s
designs.]</p>

<p>We come now to the problems, reserved from treatment in the foregoing
chapter, of scenic background. What sort of setting did the types
of theatre described afford for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span> plots, often complicated, and
the range of incident, so extraordinarily wide, which we find in
Elizabethan drama? No subject in literary history has been more often
or more minutely discussed, during the quarter of a century since the
Swan drawing was discovered, and much valuable spadework has been done,
not merely in the collecting and marshalling of external evidence,
but also in the interpretation of this in the light of an analysis of
the action of plays and of the stage-directions by which these are
accompanied.[1] Some points have emerged clearly enough; and if on
others there is still room for controversy, this may be partly due to
the fact that external and internal evidence, when put together, have
proved inadequate, and partly also to certain defects of method into
which some of the researchers have fallen. To start from the assumption
of a ‘typical Shakespearian stage’ is not perhaps the best way of
approaching an investigation which covers the practices of thirty or
forty playing companies, in a score of theatres, over a period of not
much less than a century. It is true that, in view of the constant
shifting of companies and their plays from one theatre to another, some
‘standardization of effects’, in Mr. Archer’s phrase, may at any one
date be taken for granted.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> But analogous effects can be produced
by very different arrangements, and even apart from the obvious
probability that the structural divergences between public and private
theatres led to corresponding divergences in the systems of setting
adopted, it is hardly safe to neglect the possibility of a considerable
evolution in the capacities of stage-management between 1558 and 1642,
or even between 1576 and 1616. At any rate a historical treatment
will be well advised to follow the historical method. The scope of
the inquiry, moreover, must be wide enough to cover performances at
Court, as well as those on the regular stage, since the plays used for
both purposes were undoubtedly the same. Nor can Elizabethan Court
performances, in their turn, be properly considered, except in the
perspective afforded by a short preliminary survey of the earlier
developments of the art of scenic representation at other Renaissance
Courts.</p>

<p>The story begins with the study of Vitruvius in the latter part of
the fifteenth century by the architect Alberti and others, which led
scholars to realize that the tragedies of the pseudo-Seneca and the
comedies of Terence and the recently discovered Plautus had been not
merely recited, but acted much in the fashion already familiar in
contemporary <i>ludi</i> of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span> the miracle-play type.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> The next step
was, naturally, to act them, in the original or in translations.
Alberti planned a <i>theatrum</i> in the Vatican for Nicholas V, but
the three immediate successors of Nicholas were not humanists, and it
is not until the papacy of Innocent VIII that we hear of classical
performances at Rome by the pupils of Pomponius Laetus. One of these
was Tommaso Inghirami, who became a cardinal, without escaping the
nickname of Phaedra from the part he had played in <i>Hippolytus</i>.
This, as well as at least one comedy, had already been given before
the publication (<i>c.</i> 1484–92) of an edition of Vitruvius by
Sulpicius Verulanus, with an epistle addressed by the editor to
Cardinal Raffaelle Riario, as a notable patron of the revived art.
Sulpicius is allusive rather than descriptive, but we hear of a fair
adorned stage, 5 ft. high, for the tragedy in the forum, of a second
performance in the Castle of St. Angelo, and a third in Riario’s house,
where the audience sat under <i>umbracula</i>, and of the ‘picturatae
scenae facies’, which the cardinal provided for a comedy by the
Pomponiani.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span> Performances continued after the death of Pomponius in
1597, but we get no more scenic details, and when the <i>Menaechmi</i>
was given at the wedding of Alfonso d’Este and Lucrezia Borgia in
1502 it is noted that ‘non gli era scena alcuna, perchè la camera
non era capace’.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> It is not until 1513 that we get anything like a
description of a Roman neo-classical stage, at the conferment of Roman
citizenship on Giuliano and Lorenzo de’ Medici, the Florentine kinsmen
of Leo X.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> This had a decorated back wall divided by pilasters into
five spaces, in each of which was a door covered by a curtain of golden
stuff. There were also two side-doors, for entrance and exit, marked
‘via ad forum’.</p>

<p>An even more important centre of humanistic drama than Rome was
Ferrara, where the poets and artists, who gathered round Duke Ercole
I of Este, established a tradition which spread to the allied courts
of the Gonzagas at Mantua and the Delle Rovere at Urbino. The first
neo-classical revival on record at Ferrara was of the <i>Menaechmi</i>
in 1486, from which we learn that Epidamnus was represented by five
marvellous ‘case’ each with its door and window, and that a practicable
boat moved across the <i>cortile</i> where the performance was given.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>In 1487 it was the turn of the <i>Amphitrio</i> ‘in dicto cortile
a tempo di notte, con uno paradiso cum stelle et altre rode’.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
Both the <i>Amphitrio</i> and the <i>Menaechmi</i> were revived in
1491; the former had its ‘paradiso’, while for the latter ‘nella sala
era al prospecto de quattro castelli, dove avevano a uscire quilli
dovevano fare la representatione’.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Many other productions followed,
of some of which no details are preserved. For the <i>Eunuchus</i>,
<i>Trinummus</i>, and <i>Penulus</i> in 1499 there was a stage, 4
ft. high, with decorated columns, hangings of red, white, and green
cloth, and ‘cinque casamenti merlati’ painted by Fino and Bernardino
Marsigli.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> In 1502, when Lucrezia Borgia came, the stage for
the <i>Epidicus</i>, <i>Bacchides</i>, <i>Miles Gloriosus</i>,
<i>Casina</i>, and <i>Asinaria</i> was of the height of a man, and
resembled a city wall, ‘sopra gli sono le case de le comedie, che
sono sei, non avantagiate del consueto’.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> The most elaborate
description on record is, however, one of a theatre set up at Mantua
during the carnival of 1501, for some play of which the name has not
reached us. Unfortunately it is not very clearly worded, but the stage
appears to have been rather wider than its depth, arcaded round, and
hung at the back with gold and greenery. Its base had the priceless
decoration of Mantegna’s <i>Triumphs</i>, and above was a heaven with
a representation of the zodiac. Only one ‘casa’ is noted, a ‘grocta’
within four columns at a corner of the stage.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span></p>

<p>The scanty data available seem to point to the existence of two rather
different types of staging, making their appearance at Ferrara and
at Rome respectively. The scene of the Ferrarese comedies, with its
‘case’ as the principal feature, is hardly distinguishable from that
of the mediaeval <i>sacre rappresentazioni</i>, with its ‘luoghi
deputati’ for the leading personages, which in their turn correspond
to the ‘loci’, ‘domus’, or ‘sedes’ of the western miracle-plays.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
The methods of the <i>rappresentazioni</i> had long been adopted for
pieces in the mediaeval manner, but upon secular themes, such as
Poliziano’s <i>Favola d’Orfeo</i>, which continued, side by side with
the classical comedies, to form part of the entertainment of Duke
Ercole’s Court.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> The persistence of the mediaeval tradition is very
clearly seen in the interspersing of the acts of the comedies, just as
the <i>rappresentazioni</i> had been interspersed, with ‘moresche’ and
other ‘intermedii’ of spectacle and dance, to which the ‘dumb-shows’
of the English drama owe their ultimate origin.[15] At Rome, on the
other hand, it looks as if, at any rate by 1513, the ‘case’ had been
conventionalized, perhaps under the influence of some archaeological
theory as to classical methods, into nothing more than curtained
compartments forming part of the architectural embellishments of the
<i>scena</i> wall. It is a tempting conjecture that some reflex, both
of the Ferrarese and of the Roman experiments, may be traced in the
woodcut illustrations of a number of printed editions of Terence, which
are all derived from archetypes published in the last decade of the
fifteenth century. The synchronism between<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span> the revival of classical
acting and the emergence of scenic features in such illustrations is
certainly marked. The Terentian miniatures of the earlier part of the
century show no Vitruvian knowledge. If they figure a performance,
it is a recitation by the wraith Calliopius and his gesticulating
mimes.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> Nor is there any obvious scenic influence in the printed Ulm
<i>Eunuchus</i> of 1486, with its distinct background for each separate
woodcut.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> The new spirit comes in with the Lyons <i>Terence</i>
of 1493, wherein may be seen the hand of the humanist Jodocus Badius
Ascensius, who had certainly visited Ferrara, and may well also
have been in touch with the Pomponiani.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> The Lyons woodcuts, of
which there are several to each play, undoubtedly represent stage
performances, real or imaginary. The stage itself is an unrailed
quadrangular platform, of which the supports are sometimes visible.
The back wall is decorated with statuettes and swags of Renaissance
ornament, and in front of it is a range of three, four, or five small
compartments, separated by columns and veiled by fringed curtains.
They have rather the effect of a row of bathing boxes. Over each
is inscribed the name of a character, whose ‘house’ it is supposed
to be. Thus for the <i>Andria</i> the inscriptions are ‘Carini’,
‘Chreme[tis]’, ‘Chrisidis’, ‘Do[mus] Symonis’. On the scaffold, before
the houses, action is proceeding between characters each labelled
with his name. Sometimes a curtain is drawn back and a character is
emerging, or the interior of a house is revealed, with some one sitting
or in bed, and a window behind. It is noteworthy that, while the
decoration of the back wall and the arrangement of the houses remain
uniform through all the woodcuts belonging to any one play, they vary
from play to play. Sometimes the line of houses follows that of the
wall; sometimes it advances and retires, and may leave a part of the
wall uncovered, suggesting an entrance from without. In addition to the
special woodcuts for each play, there is a large introductory design
of a ‘Theatrum’. It is a round building, with an exterior staircase,
to which spectators are proceeding,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span> and are accosted on their way by
women issuing from the ‘Fornices’, over which the theatre is built.
Through the removal of part of the walls, the interior is also made
visible. It has two galleries and standing-room below. A box next the
stage in the upper gallery is marked ‘Aediles’. The stage is cut off
by curtains, which are divided by two narrow columns. In front of the
curtains sits a flute-player. Above is inscribed ‘Proscenium’. Some of
the Lyons cuts are adopted, with others from the Ulm <i>Eunuchus</i>,
in the Strasburg <i>Terence</i> of 1496.<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> This, however, has a
different ‘Theatrum’, which shows the exterior only, and also a new
comprehensive design for each play, in which no scaffold or back wall
appears, and the houses are drawn on either side of an open place, with
the characters standing before them. They are more realistic than the
Lyons ‘bathing boxes’ and have doors and windows and roofs, but they
are drawn, like the Ulm houses, on a smaller scale than the characters.
If they have a scenic origin, it may be rather in the ‘case’ of
Ferrara than in the conventional ‘domus’ of Rome. Finally, the Venice
<i>Terence</i> of 1497, while again reproducing with modifications the
smaller Lyons cuts, replaces the ‘Theatrum’ by a new ‘Coliseus sive
Theatrum’, in which the point of view is taken from the proscenium.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
No raised stage is visible, but an actor or prologue is speaking from
a semicircular orchestra on the floor-level. To right and left of him
are two houses, of the ‘bathing-box’ type, but roofed, from which
characters emerge. He faces an auditorium with two rows of seats and a
gallery above.</p>

<p>We are moving in shadowy regions of conjecture, and if all the material
were forthcoming, the interrelations of Rome and Ferrara and the
Terentian editors might prove to have been somewhat different from
those here sketched. After all, we have not found anything which
quite explains the ‘picturatae scenae facies’ for which Cardinal
Raffaelle Riario won such praise, and perhaps Ferrara is not really
entitled to credit for the innovation, which is generally supposed
to have accompanied the production of the first of Ariosto’s great
Italian comedies on classical lines, the <i>Cassaria</i> of 1508.
This is the utilization for stage scenery of the beloved Italian
art of architectural perspective. It has been suggested, on no very
secure grounds, that the first to experiment in this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span> direction may
have been the architect Bramante Lazzari.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> But the scene of the
<i>Cassaria</i> is the earliest which is described by contemporary
observers as a <i>prospettiva</i>, and it evidently left a vivid
impression upon the imagination of the spectators.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> The artist was
Pellegrino da Udine, and the city represented was Mytilene, where the
action of the <i>Cassaria</i> was laid. The same, or another, example
of perspective may have served as a background in the following year
for Ariosto’s second comedy, <i>I Suppositi</i>, of which the scene was
Ferrara itself.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> But other artists, in other cities, followed in
the footsteps of Pellegrino. The designer for the first performance of
Bernardo da Bibbiena’s <i>Calandra</i> at Urbino in 1513 was probably
Girolamo Genga;<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> and for the second, at Rome in 1514, Baldassarre
Peruzzi, to whom Vasari perhaps gives exaggerated credit for scenes
which ‘apersono la via a coloro che ne hanno poi fatte a’ tempi
nostri’.<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> Five years later, <i>I Suppositi</i> was also revived at
Rome, in the Sala d’ Innocenzio of the Vatican, and on this occasion no
less an artist was employed than Raphael himself.<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> As well as the
scene, there was an elaborately painted front curtain, which fell at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
the beginning of the performance. For this device, something analogous
to which had almost certainly already been used at Ferrara, there was a
precedent in the classical <i>aulaeum</i>. Its object was apparently to
give the audience a sudden vision of the scene, and it was not raised
again during the action of the play, and had therefore no strictly
scenic function.<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>The sixteenth-century <i>prospettiva</i>, of which there were many
later examples, is the type of scenery so fully described and
illustrated by the architect Sebastiano Serlio in the Second Book of
his <i>Architettura</i> (1551). Serlio had himself been the designer
of a theatre at Vicenza, and had also been familiar at Rome with
Baldassarre Peruzzi, whose notes had passed into his possession. He
was therefore well in the movement.<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> At the time of the publication
of the <i>Architettura</i> he was resident in France, where he was
employed, like other Italians, by Francis I upon the palace of
Fontainebleau. Extracts from Serlio’s treatise will be found in an
appendix and I need therefore only briefly summarize here the system
of staging which it sets out.<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> This is a combination of the more
or less solid ‘case’ with flat cloths painted in perspective. The
proscenium is long and comparatively shallow, with an entrance at each
end, and flat. But from the line of the <i>scena</i> wall the level
of the stage slopes slightly upwards and backwards, and on this slope
stand to right and left the ‘case’ of boards or laths covered with
canvas, while in the centre is a large aperture, disclosing a space
across which the flat cloths are drawn, a large one at the back and
smaller ones on frames projecting by increasing degrees from behind
the ‘case’. Out of these elements is constructed, by the art of
perspective, a consistent scene with architectural perspectives facing
the audience, and broken in the centre by a symmetrical vista. For the
sake of variety, the action can use practicable doors and windows in
the façades, and to some extent also within the central aperture, on
the lower part of the slope. It was possible to arrange for interior
action by discovering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span> a space within the ‘case’ behind the façades,
but this does not seem to have been regarded as a very effective
device.<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> Nor is there anything to suggest that Serlio contemplated
any substantial amount of action within his central recess, for which,
indeed, the slope required by his principles of perspective made
it hardly suitable. As a matter of fact the action of the Italian
<i>commedia sostenuta</i>, following here the tradition of its Latin
models, is essentially exterior action before contiguous houses,
and some amusing conventions, as Creizenach notes, follow from this
fact; such as that it is reasonable to come out-of-doors in order to
communicate secrets, that the street is a good place in which to bury
treasure, and that you do not know who lives in the next house until
you are told.<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> In discussing the decoration of the stage, Serlio is
careful to distinguish between the kinds of scenery appropriate for
tragedy, comedy, and the satyric play or pastoral, respectively, herein
clearly indicating his debt and that of his school to the doctrine of
Vitruvius.</p>

<p>It must not be supposed that Serlio said the last word on Italian
Renaissance staging. He has mainly temporary theatres in his mind,
and when theatres became permanent it was possible to replace laths
and painted cloths by a more solid architectural <i>scena</i> in
relief. Of this type was the famous <i>Teatro Olympico</i> of Vicenza
begun by Andrea Palladio about 1565 and finished by Vincenzo Scamozzi
about 1584.<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> It closely followed the indications of Vitruvius,
with its <i>porta regia</i> in the middle of the <i>scena</i>, its
<i>portae minores</i> to right and left, and its proscenium doors in
<i>versurae</i> under balconies<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span> for spectators. And it did not leave
room for much variety in decoration, as between play and play.<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> It
appears, indeed, to have been used only for tragedy. A more important
tendency was really just in the opposite direction, towards change
rather than uniformity of scenic effect. Even the perspectives, however
beautiful, of the comedies did not prove quite as amusing, as the
opening heavens and hells and other ingeniously varied backgrounds of
the mediaeval plays had been, and by the end of the sixteenth century
devices were being tried for movable scenes, which ultimately led
to the complete elimination of the comparatively solid and not very
manageable ‘case’.<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>It is difficult to say how far the Italian perspective scene made its
way westwards. Mediaeval drama&mdash;on the one hand the miracle-play, on
the other the morality and the farce&mdash;still retained an unbounded
vitality in sixteenth-century France. The miracle-play had its own
elaborate and traditional system of staging. The morality and the
farce required very little staging at all, and could be content at
need with nothing more than a bare platform, backed by a semicircle
or hollow square of suspended curtains, through the interstices of
which the actors might come and go.<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> But from the beginning of
the century there is observable in educated circles an infiltration
of the humanist interest in the classical drama; and this, in course
of time, was reinforced through two distinct channels. One of these
was the educational influence, coming indirectly through Germany and
the Netherlands, of the ‘Christian Terence’, which led about 1540 to
the academic Latin tragedies of Buchanan and Muretus at Bordeaux.<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>
The other was the direct contact with humanist civilization, which
followed upon the Italian adventures of Charles VIII and Louis XII,
and dominated the reigns of François I and his house, notably after
the marriage of Catherine de’ Medici to the future Henri II in 1533.
In 1541 came Sebastiano Serlio with his comprehensive knowledge of
stage-craft; and the translation of his <i>Architettura</i>, shortly
after its publication in 1545, by Jean Martin, a friend of Ronsard,
may be taken as evidence of its vogue. In 1548 the French Court may be
said to have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span> been in immediate touch with the <i>nidus</i> of Italian
scenic art at Ferrara, for when Henri and Catherine visited Lyons it
was Cardinal Hippolyte d’Este who provided entertainment for them
with a magnificent performance of Bibbiena’s famous <i>Calandra</i>.
This was ‘nella gran sala di San Gianni’ and was certainly staged in
the full Italian manner, with perspective by Andrea Nannoccio and
a range of terra-cotta statues by one Zanobi.<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> Henceforward it
is possible to trace the existence of a Court drama in France. The
Italian influence persisted. It is not, indeed, until 1571 that we
find regular companies of Italian actors settling in Paris, and these,
when they came, probably played, mainly if not entirely, <i>commedie
dell’ arte</i>.<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> But Court performances in 1555 and 1556 of the
<i>Lucidi</i> of Firenzuola and the <i>Flora</i> of Luigi Alamanni show
that the <i>commedia sostenuta</i> was already established in favour
at a much earlier date.<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> More important, however, is the outcrop of
vernacular tragedy and comedy, on classical and Italian models, which
was one of the literary activities of the Pléiade. The pioneer in
both <i>genres</i> was Étienne Jodelle, whose tragedy of <i>Cléopâtre
Captive</i> was produced before Henri II by the author and his friends
at the Hôtel de Reims early in 1553, and subsequently repeated at the
Collège de Boncour, where it was accompanied by his comedy of <i>La
Rencontre</i>, probably identical with the extant <i>Eugène</i>, which
is believed to date from 1552. Jodelle had several successors: in
tragedy, Mellin de Saint-Gelais, Jacques and Jean de la Taille, Jacques
Grévin, Robert Garnier, Antoine de Montchrestien; and in comedy, Rémy
Belleau, Jean de Baïf, Jean de la Taille, Jacques Grévin, and Pierre
Larivey. So far as tragedy was concerned, the Court representations
soon came to an end. Catherine de’ Medici, always superstitious,
believed that the <i>Sophonisbe</i> of Mellin de Saint-Gelais in 1556
had brought ill luck, and would have no more.<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> The academies may
have continued to find hospitality for a few, but the best critical
opinion appears to be that most of the tragedies of Garnier and his
fellows were for the printing-press only, and that their scenic
indications,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span> divorced from the actualities of representation, can
hardly be regarded as evidence on any system of staging.<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> Probably
this is also true of many of the literary comedies, although Court
performances of comedies, apart from those of the professional players,
continue to be traceable throughout the century. Unfortunately
archaeological research has not succeeded in exhuming from the archives
of the French royal households anything that throws much light on the
details of staging, and very possibly little material of this kind
exists. <i>Cléopâtre</i> is said to have been produced ‘in Henrici
II aula ... magnifico veteris scenae apparatu’.<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> The prologue of
<i>Eugène</i>, again, apologizes for the meagreness of an academic
setting:</p>

  <div class="poetry-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div>Quand au théâtre, encore qu’il ne soit</div>
        <div>En demi-rond, comme on le compassoit,</div>
        <div>Et qu’on ne l’ait ordonné de la sorte</div>
        <div>Que l’on faisoit, il faut qu’on le supporte:</div>
        <div>Veu que l’exquis de ce vieil ornement</div>
        <div>Ores se voue aux Princes seulement.</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

<p>Hangings round the stage probably sufficed for the colleges, and
possibly even on some occasions for royal <i>châteaux</i>.<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> But
Jodelle evidently envisaged something more splendid as possible at
Court, and a notice, on the occasion of some comedies given before
Charles IX at Bayonne in 1565, of ‘la bravade et magnificence de la
dite scène ou théâtre, et des feux ou verres de couleur, desquelles
elle etait allumée et enrichie’ at once recalls a device dear to
Serlio, and suggests a probability that the whole method of staging,
which Serlio expounds, may at least have been tried.<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> Of an actual
theatre ‘en demi-rond’ at any French palace we have no clear proof.
Philibert de l’Orme built a <i>salle de spectacle</i> for Catherine in
the Tuileries, on a site afterwards occupied by the grand staircase,
but its shape and dimensions are not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span> on record.<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> There was another
in the pleasure-house, which he planned for Henri II in the grounds
of Saint-Germain, and which was completed by Guillaume Marchand under
Henri IV. This seems, from the extant plan, to have been designed as
a parallelogram.<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> The hall of the Hôtel de Bourbon, hard by the
Louvre, in which plays were sometimes given, is shown by the engravings
of the <i>Balet Comique</i>, which was danced there in 1581, to have
been, in the main, of similar shape. But it had an apse ‘en demi-rond’
at one end.<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> It may be that the Terence illustrations come again to
our help, and that the new engravings which appear, side by side with
others of the older tradition, in the <i>Terence</i> published by Jean
de Roigny in 1552 give some notion of the kind of stage which Jodelle
and his friends used.<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> The view is from the auditorium. The stage is
a platform, about 3½ ft. high, with three shallow steps at the back,
on which actors are sitting, while a prologue declaims. There are no
hangings or scenes. Pillars divide the back of the stage from a gallery
which runs behind and in which stand spectators. Obviously this is not
on Italian lines, but it might preserve the memory of some type of
academic stage.</p>

<p>If we know little of the scenic methods of the French Court, we know
a good deal of those employed in the only public theatre of which,
during the sixteenth century and the first quarter of the seventeenth,
Paris could boast. This was the Hôtel de Bourgogne, a rectangular
hall built by the Confrérie de la Passion in 1548, used by that body
for the representation of miracle-plays and farces up to 1598, let
between 1598 and 1608 to a succession of visiting companies, native
and foreign, and definitively occupied from the latter year by the
Comédiens du Roi, to whom Alexandre Hardy was dramatist in chief.<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>
The <i>Mémoire pour la décoration des pièces qui se représentent par
les comediens du roy, entretenus de sa Magesté</i> is one of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span> most
valuable documents of theatrical history which the hazard of time has
preserved in any land. It, or rather the earlier of the two sections
into which it is divided, is the work of Laurent Mahelot, probably a
machinist at the Hôtel de Bourgogne, and contains notes, in some cases
apparently emanating from the authors, of the scenery required for
seventy-one plays belonging to the repertory of the theatre, to which
are appended, in forty-seven cases, drawings showing the way in which
the requirements were to be met.<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> It is true that the <i>Mémoire</i>
is of no earlier date than about 1633, but the close resemblance of
the system which it illustrates to that used in the miracle-plays of
the Confrèrie de la Passion justifies the inference that there had
been no marked breach of continuity since 1598. In essence it is the
mediaeval system of juxtaposed ‘maisons’, corresponding to the ‘case’
of the Italian and the ‘houses’ of the English tradition, a series
of independent structures, visually related to each other upon the
stage, but dramatically distinct and serving, each in its turn, as the
background to action upon the whole of the free space&mdash;<i>platea</i>
in mediaeval terminology, <i>proscenium</i> in that of the
Renaissance&mdash;which stretched before and between them. The stage of the
Hôtel de Bourgogne had room for five such ‘maisons’, one in the middle
of the back wall, two in the angles between the back and side-walls,
and two standing forward against the side-walls; but in practice two or
three of these compartments were often devoted to a ‘maison’ of large
size. A ‘maison’ might be a unit of architecture, such as a palace, a
senate house, a castle, a prison, a temple, a tavern; or of landscape,
such as a garden, a wood, a rock, a cave, a sea.<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> And very often it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
represented an interior, such as a chamber with a bed in it.<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> A good
illustration of the arrangement may be found in the <i>scenario</i> for
the familiar story of Pyramus and Thisbe, as dramatized about 1617 by
Théophile de Viaud.<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘Il faut, au milieu du théâtre, un mur de marbre et pierre

<p>The <i>Pandoste</i> of Alexandre Hardy required different settings for

des rozeaux et marches de degrez.’</p>
</div>

<p>The needs of the second day were more simply met by ‘deux palais et une
maison de paysan et un bois’.</p>

<p>Many examples make it clear that the methods of the Hôtel de Bourgogne
did not entirely exclude the use of perspective, which was applied on
the back wall, ‘au milieu du théâtre’; and as the Italian stage, on its
side, was slow to abandon altogether the use of ‘case’ in relief, it is
possible that under favourable circumstances Mahelot and his colleagues
may have succeeded in producing the illusion of a consistently built
up background much upon the lines contemplated by Serlio.<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> There
were some plays whose plot called for nothing more than a single
continuous scene in a street, perhaps a known and nameable street,
or a forest.<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span> Nor was the illusion necessarily broken by such
incidents as the withdrawal of a curtain from before an interior at
the point when it came into action, or the introduction of the movable
ship which the Middle Ages had already known.<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> It was broken,
however, when the ‘belle chambre’ was so large and practicable as to
be out of scale with the other ‘maisons’.<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> And it was broken when,
as in <i>Pandoste</i> and many other plays, the apparently contiguous
‘maisons’ had to be supposed, for dramatic purposes, to be situated in
widely separated localities. It is, indeed, as we shall find to our
cost, not the continuous scene, but the need for change of scene, which
constitutes the problem of staging. It is a problem which the Italians
had no occasion to face; they had inherited, almost unconsciously, the
classical tradition of continuous action in an unchanged locality,
or in a locality no more changed than is entailed by the successive
bringing into use of various apertures in a single façade. But the
Middle Ages had had no such tradition, and the problem at once declared
itself, as soon as the matter of the Middle Ages and the manner of the
Renaissance began to come together in the ‘Christian Terence’. The
protest of Cornelius Crocus in the preface to his <i>Joseph</i> (1535)
against ‘multiple’ staging, as alike intrinsically absurd and alien
to the practice of the ancients, anticipates by many years that law
of the unity of place, the formulation of which is generally assigned
to Lodovico Castelvetro, and which was handed down by the Italians
to the Pléiade and to the ‘classical’ criticism of the seventeenth
century.<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> We are not here concerned with the unity of place as a
law of dramatic structure, but we are very much concerned with the
fact that the romantic drama of western Europe did not observe unity
of place in actual<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span> practice, and that consequently the stage-managers
of Shakespeare in England, as well as those of Hardy in France, had to
face the problem of a system of staging, which should be able rapidly
and intelligibly to represent shifting localities. The French solution,
as we have seen, was the so-called ‘multiple’ system, inherited from
the Middle Ages, of juxtaposed and logically incongruous backgrounds.</p>

<p>Geography would be misleading if it suggested that, in the westward
drift of the Renaissance, England was primarily dependent upon the
mediation of France. During the early Tudor reigns direct relations
with Italy were firmly established, and the classical scholars of
Oxford and Cambridge drew their inspiration at first hand from the
authentic well-heads of Rome and Florence. In matters dramatic, in
particular, the insular had little or nothing to learn from the
continental kingdom. There were French players, indeed, at the Court
of Henry VII in 1494 and 1495, who obviously at that date can only
have had farces and morals to contribute.<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> And thereafter the
lines of stimulus may just as well have run the other way. If the
academic tragedy and comedy of the Pléiade had its reaction upon the
closet dramas of Lady Pembroke, Kyd, Daniel, Lord Brooke, yet London
possessed its public theatres long before the Parisian makeshift of
the Hôtel de Bourgogne, and English, no less than Italian, companies
haunted the Court of Henri IV, while it is not until Caroline days
that the French visit of 1495 can be shown to have had its successor.
The earliest record of a classical performance in England was at
Greenwich on 7 March 1519, when ‘there was a goodly commedy of Plautus
plaied’, followed by a mask, in the great chamber, which the King had
caused ‘to be staged and great lightes to be set on pillers that were
gilt, with basons gilt, and the rofe was covered with blewe satyn
set full of presses of fyne gold and flowers’.<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> The staging here
spoken of, in association with lights, was probably for spectators
rather than for actors, for in May 1527, when a dialogue, barriers,
and mask were to be given in a banqueting-house at Greenwich, we are
told that ‘thys chambre was raised with stages v. degrees on every
syde, and rayled and counterailed, borne by pillars of azure, full<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
of starres and flower delice of gold; every pillar had at the toppe
a basin silver, wherein stode great braunches of white waxe’.<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> In
this same year 1527, Wolsey had a performance of the <i>Menaechmi</i>
at his palace of York Place, and it was followed in 1528 by one of
the <i>Phormio</i>, of which a notice is preserved in a letter of
Gasparo Spinelli, the secretary to the Italian embassy in London.<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>
Unfortunately, Spinelli’s description proves rather elusive. I am not
quite clear whether he is describing the exterior or the interior of a
building, and whether his <i>zoglia</i> is, as one would like to think,
the framework of a proscenium arch, or merely that of a doorway.<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>
One point, however, is certain. Somewhere or other, the decorations
displayed in golden letters the title of the play which was about to
be given. Perhaps this explains why, more than a quarter of a century
later, when the Westminster boys played the <i>Miles Gloriosus</i>
before Elizabeth in January 1565, one of the items of expenditure was
for ‘paper, inke and colores for the wryting of greate letters’.<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<p>Investigation of Court records reveals nothing more precise than
this as to the staging of plays, whether classical or mediaeval in
type, under Henry VIII. It is noticeable, however, that a play often
formed but one episode in a composite entertainment, other parts of
which required the elaborate pageantry which was Henry’s contribution
to the development of the mask; and it may be conjectured that in
these cases the structure of the pageant served also as a sufficient
background for the play. Thus in 1527 a Latin tragedy celebrating the
deliverance of the Pope and of France by Wolsey was given in the ‘great
chamber of disguysings’, at the end of which stood a fountain with a
mulberry and a hawthorn tree, about which sat eight fair ladies in
strange attire upon ‘benches of rosemary fretted in braydes layd on
gold, all the sydes sette wyth roses in braunches as they wer growyng
about this fountayne’.<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> The device<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span> was picturesque enough, but can
only have had an allegorical relation to the action of the play. The
copious Revels Accounts of Edward and of Mary are silent about play
settings. It is only with those of Elizabeth that the indications of
‘houses’ and curtains already detailed in an earlier chapter make their
appearance.<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> The ‘houses’ of lath and canvas have their analogy
alike in the ‘case’ of Ferrara, which even Serlio had not abandoned,
and in the ‘maisons’ which the Hôtel de Bourgogne inherited from the
Confrérie de la Passion. We are left without guide as to whether the
use of them at the English Court was a direct tradition from English
miracle-plays, or owed its immediate origin to an Italian practice,
which was itself in any case only an outgrowth of mediaeval methods
familiar in Italy as well as in England. Nor can we tell, so far as the
Revels Accounts go, whether the ‘houses’ were juxtaposed on the stage
after the ‘multiple’ fashion of the Hôtel de Bourgogne, or were fused
with the help of perspective into a continuous façade or vista, as
Serlio bade. Certainly the Revels officers were not wholly ignorant of
the use of perspective, but this is also true of the machinists of the
Hôtel de Bourgogne.<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> Serlio does not appear to have used curtains,
as the Revels officers did, for the discovery of interior scenes, but
if, on the other hand, any of the great curtains of the Revels were
front curtains, these were employed at Ferrara and Rome, and we have no
knowledge that they were employed at Paris. At this point the archives
leave us fairly in an <i>impasse</i>.</p>

<p>It will be well to start upon a new tack and to attempt to ascertain,
by an analysis of such early plays as survive, what kind of setting
these can be supposed, on internal evidence, to have needed. And
the first and most salient fact which emerges is that a very large
number of them needed practically no setting at all. This is broadly
true, with exceptions which shall be detailed, of the great group
of interludes which extends over about fifty years of the sixteenth
century, from the end of Henry VII’s reign or the beginning of Henry
VIII’s, to a point in Elizabeth’s almost coincident with the opening of
the theatres. Of these, if mere fragments<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span> are neglected, there are not
less than forty-five. Twenty are Henrican;<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> perhaps seven Edwardian
or Marian;<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> eighteen Elizabethan.<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> Characteristically, they are
morals, presenting abstract personages varied in an increasing degree
with farcical types; but several are semi-morals, with a sprinkling
of concrete personages, which point backwards to the miracle-plays,
or forward to the romantic or historical drama. One or two are almost
purely miracle-play or farce; and towards the end one or two show some
traces of classical influence.<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> Subject, then, to the exceptions,
the interludes&mdash;and this, as already indicated, is a fundamental point
for staging&mdash;call for no changes of locality, with which, indeed, the
purely abstract themes of moralities could easily dispense. The action
proceeds continuously in a locality, which is either wholly undefined,
or at the most vaguely defined as in London (<i>Hickscorner</i>),
or in England (<i>King Johan</i>). This is referred to, both in
stage-directions and in dialogue, as ‘the place’, and with such
persistency as inevitably to suggest a term of art, of which the
obvious derivation is from the <i>platea</i> of the miracle-plays.<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>
It may be either an exterior or an interior place, but often it is
not clearly envisaged as either. In <i>Pardoner and Friar</i> and
possibly in <i>Johan the Evangelist</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span> it is a church; in <i>Johan
Johan</i> it is Johan’s house. Whether interior or exterior, a door
is often referred to as the means of entrance and exit for the
characters.<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> In <i>Johan Johan</i> a door is supposed to lead to
the priest’s chamber, and there is a long colloquy at the ‘chamber
dore’. In exterior plays some kind of a house may be suggested in close
proximity to the ‘place’. In <i>Youth</i> and in <i>Four Elements</i>
the characters come and go to a tavern. The ‘place’ of <i>Apius and
Virginia</i> is before the gate of Apius. There is no obvious necessity
why these houses should have been represented by anything but a door.
The properties used in the action are few and simple; a throne or
other seat, a table or banquet (<i>Johan Johan</i>, <i>Godly Queen
Hester</i>, <i>King Darius</i>), a hearth (<i>Nature</i>, <i>Johan
Johan</i>), a pulpit (<i>Johan the Evangelist</i>), a pail (<i>Johan
Johan</i>), a dice-board (<i>Nice Wanton</i>). My inference is that
the setting of the interludes was nothing but the hall in which
performances were given, with for properties the plenishing of that
hall or such movables as could be readily carried in. Direct hints
are not lacking to confirm this view. A stage-direction in <i>Four
Elements</i> tells us that at a certain point ‘the daunsers without the
hall syng’. In <i>Impatient Poverty</i> (242) Abundance comes in with
the greeting, ‘Joye and solace be in this hall!’ <i>All for Money</i>
(1019) uses ‘this hall’, where we should expect ‘this place’. And I
think that, apart from interludes woven into the pageantry of Henry
VIII’s disguising chambers, the hall contemplated was at first just the
ordinary everyday hall, after dinner or supper, with the sovereigns or
lords still on the dais, the tables and benches below pushed aside,
and a free space left for the performers on the floor, with the
screen and its convenient doors as a background and the hearth ready
to hand if it was wanted to figure in the action. If I am right, the
staged dais, with the sovereign on a high state in the middle of the
hall, was a later development, or a method reserved for very formal
entertainments.<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> The actors of the more homely interlude would have
had to rub shoulders all the time with the inferior members of their
audience. And so they did. In <i>Youth</i> (39) the principal character
enters, for all the world like the St. George of a village mummers’
play, with an</p>

      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

<p>A similar and earlier example than any of these now presents itself in
<i>Fulgens and Lucres</i>, where there is an inductive dialogue between
spectators, one of whom says to another</p>

  <div class="poetry-container">
    <div class="poetry">

      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

<p>Of a raised stage the only indication is in <i>All for Money</i>, a
late example of the type, where one stage-direction notes (203), ‘There
must be a chayre for him to sit in, and vnder it or neere the same
there must be some hollowe place for one to come vp in’, while another
(279) requires ‘some fine conueyance’ to enable characters to vomit
each other up.</p>

<p>I come now to nine interludes which, for various reasons, demand
special remark. In <i>Jacob and Esau</i> (&gt; 1558) there is coming and
going between the place and the tent of Isaac, before which stands
a bench, the tent of Jacob, and probably also the tent of Esau. In
<i>Wit and Wisdom</i> (&gt; 1579) action takes place at the entrances of
the house of Wantonness, of the den of Irksomeness, of a prison, and
of Mother Bee’s house, and the prison, as commonly in plays of later
types, must have been so arranged as to allow a prisoner to take part
in the dialogue from within. Some realism, also, in the treatment of
the den may be signified by an allusion to ‘these craggie clifts’. In
<i>Misogonus</i> (<i>c.</i> 1560–77), the place of which is before
the house of Philogonus, there is one scene in Melissa’s ‘bowre’ (ii.
4, 12), which must somehow have been represented. In <i>Thersites</i>
(1537), of which one of the characters is a snail that ‘draweth her
hornes in’, Mulciber, according to the stage-directions, ‘must have a
shop made in the place’, which he leaves and returns to, and in which
he is perhaps seen making a sallet. Similarly, the Mater of Thersites,
when she drops out of the dialogue, ‘goeth in the place which is
prepared for her’, and hither later ‘Thersites must ren awaye, and
hyde hym behynde hys mothers backe’. These four examples only differ
from the normal interlude type by some multiplication of the houses
suggested in the background, and probably by some closer approximation
than a mere door to the visual realization of these. There is no change
of locality, and only an adumbration of interior<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span> action within the
houses. Four other examples do entail some change of locality. Much
stress must not be laid on the sudden conversions in the fourth act
of <i>The Conflict of Conscience</i> (&gt; 1581) and the last scene of
<i>Three Ladies of London</i> of the open ‘place’ into Court, for these
are very belated specimens of the moral. And the opening dialogue
of the <i>Three Ladies</i>, on the way to London, may glide readily
enough into the main action before two houses in London itself. But in
<i>The Disobedient Child</i> (<i>c.</i> 1560) some episodes are before
the house of the father, and others before that of the son in another
locality forty miles away. In <i>Mary Magdalene</i> (&lt; 1566), again,
the action begins in Magdalo, but there is a break (842) when Mary
and the Vice start on their travels, and it is resumed at Jerusalem,
where it proceeds first in some public place, and afterwards by a
sudden transition (1557) at a repast within the house of Simon. In both
cases it may be conjectured that the two localities were indicated on
opposite sides of the hall or stage, and that the personages travelled
from one to the other over the intervening space, which was regarded
as representing a considerable distance. You may call this ‘multiple
staging’, if you will. The same imaginative foreshortening of space
had been employed both in the miracle-plays and in the ‘Christian
Terence’.<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> Simon’s house at Jerusalem was, no doubt, some kind of
open <i>loggia</i> with a table in it, directly approachable from the
open place where the earlier part of the Jerusalem action was located.</p>

<p><i>Godly Queen Hester</i> (? 1525–9) has a different interest, in
that, of all the forty-four interludes, it affords the only possible
evidence for the use of a curtain. In most respects it is quite a
normal interlude. The action is continuous, in a ‘place’, which
represents a council-chamber, with a chair for Ahasuerus. But there
is no mention of a door, and while the means of exit and entrance for
the ordinary personages are unspecified, the stage-directions note, on
two occasions (139, 635) when the King goes out, that he ‘entreth the
trauerse’. Now ‘traverses’ have played a considerable part in attempts
to reconstruct the Elizabethan theatre, and some imaginative writers
have depicted them as criss-crossing about the stage in all sorts of
possible and impossible directions.<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span> The term is not a very happy
one to employ in the discussion of late sixteenth-century or early
seventeenth-century conditions. After <i>Godly Queen Hester</i> it does
not appear again in any play for nearly a hundred years, and then,
so far as I know, is only used by Jonson in <i>Volpone</i>, where it
appears to indicate a low movable screen, probably of a non-structural
kind, and by John Webster, both in <i>The White Devil</i> and in
<i>The Duchess of Malfi</i>, where it is an exact equivalent to the
‘curtains’ or ‘arras’, often referred to as screening off a recess at
the back of the stage.<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> Half a century later still, it is used in
the Restoration play of <i>The Duke of Guise</i> to indicate, not this
normal back curtain, but a screen placed across the recess itself, or
the inner stage which had developed out of it, behind ‘the scene’.<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>
Webster’s use seems to be an individual one. Properly a ‘traverse’
means, I think, not a curtain suspended from the roof, but a screen
shutting off from view a compartment within a larger room, but leaving
it open above. Such a screen might, of course, very well be formed by a
curtain running on a rod or cord.<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> And a ‘traverse’ also certainly
came to mean the compartment itself which was so shut off.<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> The
construction is familiar in the old-fashioned pews of our churches,
and as it happens, it is from the records of the royal chapel that its
Elizabethan use can best be illustrated. Thus when Elizabeth took her
Easter communion at St. James’s in 1593, she came down, doubtless from
her ‘closet’ above, after the Gospel had been read, ‘into her Majestes
Travess’, whence she emerged to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span> make her offering, and then ‘retorned
to her princely travess sumptuously sett forthe’, until it was time
to emerge again and receive the communion. So too, when the Spanish
treaty was sworn in 1604, ‘in the chappell weare two traverses sett
up of equall state in all thinges as neare as might be’. One was the
King’s traverse ‘where he usually sitteth’, the other for the Spanish
ambassador, and from them they proceeded to ‘the halfe pace’ for the
actual swearing of the oath.<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> The traverse figures in several other
chapel ceremonies of the time, and it is by this analogy, rather
than as a technical term of stage-craft, that we must interpret the
references to it in <i>Godly Queen Hester</i>. It is not inconceivable
that the play, which was very likely performed by the Chapel, was
actually performed in the chapel.<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> Nor is it inconceivable, also,
that the sense of the term ‘traverse’ may have been wide enough to
cover the screen at the bottom of a Tudor hall.</p>

<p>I come now to the group of four mid-century farces, <i>Gammer Gurton’s
Needle</i>, <i>Jack Juggler</i>, <i>Ralph Roister Doister</i>, and
<i>Tom Tyler</i>, which literary historians have distinguished from
the interludes as early ‘regular comedies’. No doubt they show traces
of Renaissance influence upon their dramatic handling. But, so far as
scenic setting is concerned, they do not diverge markedly from the
interlude type. Nor is this surprising, since Renaissance comedy, like
the classical comedy upon which it was based, was essentially an affair
of continuous action, in an open place, before a background of houses.
<i>Gammer Gurton’s Needle</i> requires two houses, those of Gammer
Gurton and of Dame Chat; <i>Jack Juggler</i> one, that of Boungrace;
<i>Ralph Roister Doister</i> one, that of Christian Custance. Oddly
enough, both <i>Gammer Gurton’s Needle</i> and <i>Jack Juggler</i>
contain indications of the presence of a post, so placed that it could
be used in the action.<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> <i>Tom Tyler</i>, which may have reached us
in a sophisticated text, has a slightly more complicated staging. There
are some quite early features. The locality is ‘this place’ (835), and
the audience are asked (18), as in the much earlier <i>Youth</i>, to
‘make them room’. On the other hand, as in <i>Mary Magdalene</i> and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
in <i>The Conflict of Conscience</i>, there is at one point (512) a
transition from exterior to interior action. Hitherto it has been in
front of Tom’s house; now it is within, and his wife is in bed. An
open <i>loggia</i> here hardly meets the case. The bed demands some
discovery, perhaps by the withdrawal of a curtain.</p>

<p>I am of course aware that the forty-four interludes and the four farces
hitherto dealt with cannot be regarded as forming a homogeneous body
of Court drama. Not one of them, in fact, can be absolutely proved to
have been given at Court. Several of them bear signs of having been
given elsewhere, including at least three of the small number which
present exceptional features.<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> Others lie under suspicion of having
been written primarily for the printing-press, in the hope that any
one who cared to act them would buy copies, and may therefore never
have been given at all; and it is obvious that in such circumstances a
writer might very likely limit himself to demands upon stage-management
far short of what the Court would be prepared to meet.<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> This is
all true enough, but at the same time I see no reason to doubt that
the surviving plays broadly represent the kind of piece that was
produced, at Court as well as elsewhere, until well into Elizabeth’s
reign. Amongst their authors are men, Skelton, Medwall, Rastell,
Redford, Bale, Heywood, Udall, Gascoigne, who were about the Court,
and some of whom we know to have written plays, if not these plays,
for the Court; and the survival of the moral as a Court entertainment
is borne witness to by the Revels Accounts of 1578–9, in which the
‘morrall of the <i>Marriage of Mind and Measure</i>’ still holds its
own beside the classical and romantic histories which had already
become fashionable. As we proceed, however, we come more clearly
within the Court sphere. The lawyers stand very close, in their
interests and their amusements, to the Court, and with the next group
of plays, a characteristically Renaissance one, of four Italianate
comedies and four Senecan tragedies, the lawyers had a good deal to
do. Gascoigne’s Gray’s Inn <i>Supposes</i> is based directly upon one
of Ariosto’s epoch-making comedies, <i>I Suppositi</i>, and adopts its
staging. Jeffere’s <i>Bugbears</i> and the anonymous <i>Two Italian
Gentlemen</i> are similarly indebted to their models<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span> in Grazzini’s
<i>La Spiritata</i> and Pasqualigo’s <i>Il Fedele</i>. Each preserves
complete unity of place, and the continuous action in the street before
the houses, two or three in number, of the principal personages, is
only varied by occasional colloquies at a door or window, and in the
case of the <i>Two Italian Gentlemen</i> by an episode of concealment
in a tomb which stands in a ‘temple’ or shrine beneath a burning
lamp. Whetstone’s <i>Promos and Cassandra</i>, the neo-classical
inspiration of which is advertised in the prefatory epistle, follows
the same formula with a certain freedom of handling. In the first part,
opportunity for a certain amount of interior action is afforded by
two of the three houses; one is a prison, the other a barber’s shop,
presumably an open stall with a door and a flap-down shutter. The third
is the courtesan’s house, on which Serlio insists. This reappears in
the second part and has a window large enough for four women to sit
in.<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> The other houses in this part are a temple with a tomb in it,
and a pageant stage used at a royal entry. The conveniences of exterior
action lead to a convention which often recurs in later plays, by which
royal justice is dispensed in the street. And the strict unity of place
is broken by a scene (iv. 2) which takes place, not like the rest of
the action in the town of Julio, but in a wood through which the actors
are approaching it. Here also we have, I think, the beginnings of a
convention by which action on the extreme edge of a stage, or possibly
on the floor of the hall or on steps leading to the stage, was treated
as a little remote from the place represented by the setting in the
background. The four tragedies were all produced at the Court itself by
actors from the Inns of Court. It is a little curious that the earliest
of the four, <i>Gorboduc</i> (1562), is also the most regardless of
the unity of place. While Acts <span class="allsmcap">I</span> and <span class="allsmcap">III</span>-<span class="allsmcap">V</span>
are at the Court of Gorboduc, Act <span class="allsmcap">II</span> is divided between the
independent Courts of Ferrex and Porrex. We can hardly suppose that
there was any substantial change of decoration, and probably the same<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
generalized palace background served for all three. Here also the
convention, classical enough, rules, by which the affairs of state are
conducted in the open. By 1562 the raised stage had clearly established
itself. There are no regular stage-directions in <i>Gorboduc</i>, but
the stage is often mentioned in the descriptions of the dumb-shows
between the acts, and in the fourth of these ‘there came from vnder
the stage, as though out of hell, three furies’. Similarly in
<i>Jocasta</i> (1566) the stage opens in the dumb-shows to disclose,
at one time a grave, at another the gulf of Curtius. The action of
the play itself is before the palace of Jocasta, but there are also
entrances and exits, which are carefully specified in stage-directions
as being through ‘the gates called Electrae’ and ‘the gates called
Homoloydes’. Perhaps we are to infer that the gates which, if the
stage-manager had Vitruvius in mind, would have stood on the right and
left of the proscenium, were labelled ‘in great letters’ with their
names; and if so, a similar device may have served in <i>Gorboduc</i>
to indicate at which of the three Courts action was for the time
being proceeding. <i>Gismond of Salerne</i> has not only a hell, for
Megaera, but also a heaven, for the descent and ascent of Cupid. Like
<i>Jocasta</i>, it preserves unity of place, but it has two houses in
the background, the palace of Tancred and an independent ‘chamber’ for
Gismond, which is open enough and deep enough to allow part of the
action, with Gismond lying poisoned and Tancred mourning over her, to
take place within it. <i>The Misfortunes of Arthur</i> is, of course,
twenty years later than the other members of the group. But it is true
to type. The action is in front of three <i>domus</i>, the ‘houses’ of
Arthur and of Mordred, which ought not perhaps historically to have
been in the same city, and a cloister. A few years later still, in
1591, Wilmot, one of the authors of <i>Gismond of Salerne</i>, rewrote
it as <i>Tancred and Gismund</i>. He did not materially interfere with
the old staging, but he added an epilogue, of which the final couplet
runs:</p>

  <div class="poetry-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div>Thus end our sorrowes with the setting sun:</div>
        <div>Now draw the curtens for our Scaene is done.</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

<p>If these lines had occurred in the original version of the play, they
would naturally have been taken as referring to curtains used to cover
and discover Gismond’s death-chamber. But in this point Wilmot has
modified the original action, and has made Gismund take her poison and
die, not in her chamber, but on the open stage. Are we then faced,
as part of the paraphernalia of a Court stage, at any rate by 1591,
with a front curtain&mdash;a curtain drawn aside, and not sinking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span> like the
curtains of Ferrara and Rome, but like those curtains used to mark the
beginning and end of a play, rather than to facilitate any changing
of scenes?<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> It is difficult to say. Wilmot, not re-writing for the
stage, may have rewritten loosely. Or the epilogue may after all have
belonged to the first version of the play, and have dropped out of the
manuscript in which that version is preserved. The Revels Accounts
testify that ‘great curtains’ were used in Court plays, but certainly
do not prove that they were used as front curtains. The nearest
approach to a corroboration of Wilmot is to be found in an epigram
which exists in various forms, and is ascribed in some manuscripts to
Sir Walter Raleigh.<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>

<p>If these four comedies and four tragedies were taken alone, it
would, I think, be natural to conclude that, with the Italianized
types of drama, the English Court had also adopted the Italian type
of setting.<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> Certainly the tragedies would fit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span> well enough into
Serlio’s stately façade of palaces, and the comedies into his more
homely group of bourgeois houses, with its open shop, its ‘temple’, and
its discreet abode of a <i>ruffiana</i>.<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></p>

<p>As courtly, beyond doubt, we must treat the main outlook of the
choir companies during their long hegemony of the Elizabethan drama,
which ended with the putting down of Paul’s in 1590. Unfortunately
it is not until the last decade of this period, with the ‘court
comedies’ of Lyly, that we have any substantial body of their work,
differentiated from the interludes and the Italianate comedies, to go
upon. The <i>Damon and Pythias</i> of Richard Edwardes has a simple
setting before the gates of a court. Lyly’s own methods require rather
careful analysis.<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> The locality of <i>Campaspe</i> is throughout
at Athens, in ‘the market-place’ (<span class="allsmcap">III.</span> ii. 56).<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> On this
there are three <i>domus</i>: Alexander’s palace, probably represented
by a portico in which he receives visitors, and from which inmates
‘draw in’ (<span class="allsmcap">IV.</span> iii. 32) to get off the stage; a tub ‘turned
towardes the sun’ (<span class="allsmcap">I.</span> iii. 12) for Diogenes over which he can
‘pry’ (<span class="allsmcap">V.</span> iii. 21); a shop for Apelles, which has a window
(<span class="allsmcap">III.</span> i. 18), outside which a page is posted, and open enough
for Apelles to carry on dialogue with Campaspe (<span class="allsmcap">III.</span> iii.;
<span class="allsmcap">IV.</span> iv), while he paints her within. These three <i>domus</i>
are quite certainly all visible together, as continuous action can
pass from one to another. At one point (<span class="allsmcap">I.</span> iii. 110) the
philosophers walk direct from the palace to the tub; at another
(<span class="allsmcap">III.</span> iv. 44, 57) Alexander, going to the shop, passes the
tub on the way; at a third (<span class="allsmcap">V.</span> iv. 82) Apelles, standing
at the tub, is bidden ‘looke about you, your shop is on fire!’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span> As
Alexander (<span class="allsmcap">V.</span> iv. 71) tells Diogenes that he ‘wil haue thy
cabin remoued nerer to my court’, I infer that the palace and the tub
were at opposite ends of the stage, and the shop in the middle, where
the interior action could best be seen. In <i>Sapho and Phao</i> the
unity of place is not so marked. All the action is more or less at
Syracuse, but, with the exception of one scene (<span class="allsmcap">II.</span> iii), the
whole of the first two acts are near Phao’s ferry outside the city.
I do not think that the actual ferry is visible, for passengers go
‘away’ (<span class="allsmcap">I.</span> i. 72; ii. 69) to cross, and no use is made of a
ferryman’s house, but somewhere quite near Sibylla sits ‘in the mouth
of her caue’ (<span class="allsmcap">II.</span> i. 13), and talks with Phao.<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> The rest of
the action is in the city itself, either before the palace of Sapho,
or within her chamber, or at the forge of Vulcan, where he is perhaps
seen ‘making of the arrowes’ (<span class="allsmcap">IV.</span> iv. 33) during a song.
Certainly Sapho’s chamber is practicable. The stage-directions do not
always indicate its opening and shutting. At one point (<span class="allsmcap">III.</span>
iii. 1) we simply get ‘Sapho in her bed’ in a list of interlocutors;
at another (<span class="allsmcap">IV.</span> i. 20) ‘Exit Sapho’, which can only mean
that the door closes upon her. It was a door, not a curtain, for she
tells a handmaid (<span class="allsmcap">V.</span> ii. 101) to ‘shut’ it. Curtains are
‘drawne’ (<span class="allsmcap">III.</span> iii. 36; <span class="allsmcap">IV.</span> iii. 95), but these are
bed-curtains, and the drawing of them does not put Sapho’s chamber in
or out of action. As in <i>Campaspe</i>, there is interplay between
house and house. A long continuous stretch of action, not even broken
by the act-intervals, begins with <span class="allsmcap">III.</span> iii and extends to
the end of <span class="allsmcap">V.</span> ii, and in the course of this Venus sends
Cupid to Sapho, and herself waits at Vulcan’s forge (<span class="allsmcap">V.</span> i.
50). Presently (<span class="allsmcap">V.</span> ii. 45) she gets tired of waiting, and
without leaving the stage, advances to the chamber and says, ‘How
now, in Saphoes lap?’ There is not the same interplay between the
city houses and Sibylla’s cave, to which the last scene of the play
returns. I think we must suppose that two neighbouring spots within
the same general locality were shown in different parts of the stage,
and this certainly entails a bolder use of dramatic foreshortening of
distance than the mere crossing the market-place in <i>Campaspe</i>.
This foreshortening recurs in <i>Endymion</i>. Most of the action
is in an open place which must be supposed to be near the palace of
Cynthia, or at the lunary bank (<span class="allsmcap">II.</span> iii. 9), of Endymion’s
slumber, which is also near the palace.<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> It stands in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span> a grove
(<span class="allsmcap">IV.</span> iii. 160), and is called a ‘caban’ (<span class="allsmcap">IV.</span> iii.
111). Somewhere also in the open space is, in Act <span class="allsmcap">V</span>, the
aspen-tree, into which Dipsas has turned Bagoa and from which she is
delivered (<span class="allsmcap">V.</span> iii. 283). But <span class="allsmcap">III.</span> ii and <span class="allsmcap">IV.</span>
i are at the door of ‘the Castle in the Deserte’ (<span class="allsmcap">III.</span> i. 41;
ii. 1) and <span class="allsmcap">III.</span> iv is also in the desert (cf. <span class="allsmcap">V.</span>
iii. 35), before a fountain. This fountain was, however, ‘hard by’
the lunary bank (<span class="allsmcap">IV.</span> ii. 67), and probably the desert was
no farther off than the end of the stage.<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> In <i>Midas</i> the
convention of foreshortening becomes inadequate, and we are faced with
a definite change of locality. The greater part of the play is at the
Court of Midas, presumably in Lydia rather than in Phrygia, although
an Elizabethan audience is not likely to have been punctilious about
Anatolian geography. Some scenes require as background a palace, to
which it is possible to go ‘in’ (<span class="allsmcap">I.</span> i. 117; <span class="allsmcap">II.</span> ii.
83; <span class="allsmcap">III.</span> iii. 104). A temple of Bacchus may also have been
represented, but is not essential. Other scenes are in a neighbouring
spot, where the speaking reeds grow. There is a hunting scene
(<span class="allsmcap">IV.</span> i) on ‘the hill Tmolus’ (cf. <span class="allsmcap">V.</span> iii. 44). So
far Lyly’s canons of foreshortening are not exceeded. But the last
scene (<span class="allsmcap">V.</span> iii) is out of the picture altogether. The opening
words are ‘This is Delphos’, and we are overseas, before the temple
of Apollo. In <i>Galathea</i> and in <i>Love’s Metamorphosis</i>, on
the other hand, unity is fully achieved. The whole of <i>Galathea</i>
may well proceed in a single spot, on the edge of a wood, before a
tree sacred to Neptune, and in Lincolnshire (<span class="allsmcap">I.</span> iv. 12).
The sea is hard by, but need not be seen. The action of <i>Love’s
Metamorphosis</i> is rather more diffuse, but an all-over pastoral
setting, such as we see in Serlio’s <i>scena satirica</i>, with
scattered <i>domus</i> in different glades, would serve it. Or, as
the management of the Hôtel de Bourgogne would have put it, the stage
is <i>tout en pastoralle</i>. There are a tree of Ceres and a temple
of Cupid. These are used successively in the same scene (<span class="allsmcap">II.</span>
i). Somewhat apart, on the sea-shore, but close to the wood, dwells
Erisichthon. There is a rock for the Siren, and Erisichthon’s house may
also have been shown.<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> Finally, <i>Mother Bombie</i> is an extreme<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
example of the traditional Italian comic manner. The action comes and
goes, rapidly for Lyly, in an open place, surrounded by no less than
seven houses, the doors of which are freely used.</p>

<p>Two other Chapel plays furnish sufficient evidence that the type of
staging just described was not Lyly’s and Lyly’s alone.<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> Peele’s
<i>Arraignment of Paris</i> is <i>tout en pastoralle</i>. A poplar-tree
dominates the stage throughout, and the only house is a bower of
Diana, large enough to hold the council of gods (381, 915). A trap
is required for the rising and sinking of a golden tree (489) and
the ascent of Pluto (902). Marlowe’s <i>Dido</i> has proved rather a
puzzle to editors who have not fully appreciated the principles on
which the Chapel plays were produced. I think that one side of the
stage was arranged <i>en pastoralle</i>, and represented the wood
between the sea-shore and Carthage, where the shipwrecked Trojans
land and where later Aeneas and Dido hunt. Here was the cave where
they take shelter from the storm.<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> Here too must have been the
curtained-off <i>domus</i> of Jupiter.<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> This is only used in a kind
of prelude. Of course it ought to have been in heaven, but the Gods are
omnipresent, and it is quite clear that when the curtain is drawn on
Jupiter, Venus, who has been discoursing with him, is left in the wood,
where she then meets<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span> Aeneas (134, 139, 173). The other side of the
stage represents Carthage. Possibly a wall with a gate in it was built
across the stage, dividing off the two regions. In the opening line of
Act <span class="allsmcap">II</span>, Aeneas says,</p>

  <div class="poetry-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div>Where am I now? these should be Carthage walles,</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

<p class="p-left">and we must think of him as advancing through the wood to the
gate.<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> He is amazed at a carved or printed representation of Troy,
which Virgil placed in a temple of Juno, but which Marlowe probably
thought of as at the gate. He meets other Trojans who have already
reached the city, and they call his attention to Dido’s servitors,
who ‘passe through the hall’ bearing a banquet. Evidently he is now
within the city and has approached a <i>domus</i> representing the
palace. The so-called ‘hall’ is probably an open <i>loggia</i>. Here
Dido entertains him, and in a later scene (773) points out to him the
pictures of her suitors. There is perhaps an altar in front of the
palace, where Iarbas does his sacrifice (1095), and somewhere close
by a pyre is made for Dido (1692). Either within or without the walls
may be the grove in which Ascanius is hidden while Cupid takes his
place.<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> If, as is more probable, it is without, action passes
through the gate when Venus beguiles him away. It certainly does at the
beginning (912, 960) and end (1085) of the hunt, and again when Aeneas
first attempts flight and Anna brings him back from the sea-shore
(1151, 1207).</p>

<p>The plays of the Lylyan school, if one may so call it, seem to me to
illustrate very precisely, on the side of staging, that blend of the
classical and the romantic tempers which is characteristic of the later
Renaissance. The mediaeval instinct for a story, which the Elizabethans
fully shared, is with difficulty accommodated to the form of an action
coherent in place and time, which the Italians had established on the
basis of Latin comedy. The Shakespearian romantic drama is on the
point of being born. Lyly and his fellow University wits deal with
the problem to the best of their ability. They widen the conception
of locality, to a city and its environs instead of a street; and even
then the narrative<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span> sometimes proves unmanageable, and the distance
from one end of the stage to the other must represent a foreshortening
of leagues, or even of the crossing of an ocean. In the hands of less
skilful workmen the tendency was naturally accentuated, and plays had
been written, long before Lyly was sent down from Magdalen, in which
the episodes of breathless adventure altogether overstepped the most
elastic confines of locality. A glance at the titles of the plays
presented at Court during the second decade of Elizabeth’s reign will
show the extent to which themes drawn from narrative literature were
already beginning to oust those of the old interlude type.<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> The
new development is apparent in the contributions both of men and of
boys; with this distinction, that the boys find their sources mainly
in the storehouse of classical history and legend, while the men turn
either to contemporary events at home and abroad, or more often to the
belated and somewhat jaded versions, still dear to the Elizabethan
laity, of mediaeval romance. The break-down of the Italian staging must
therefore be regarded from the beginning, as in part at least a result
of the reaction of popular taste upon that of the Court. The noblemen’s
players came to London when the winter set in, and brought with them
the pieces which had delighted <i>bourgeois</i> and village audiences
up and down the land throughout the summer; and on the whole it proved
easier for the Revels officers to adapt the stage to the plays than the
plays to the stage. Nor need it be doubted that, even in so cultivated
a Court as that of Elizabeth, the popular taste was not without its
echoes.</p>

<p>Of all this wealth of forgotten play-making, only five examples
survive; but they are sufficient to indicate the scenic trend.<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a>
Their affiliation with the earlier interludes is direct. The ‘vice’ and
other moral abstractions still mingle with the concrete personages, and
the proscenium is still the ‘place’.<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> The simplest setting is that
of <i>Cambyses</i>. All is at or within sight of the Persian Court. If
any <i>domus</i> was represented, it was the palace, to which there are
departures (567, 929). Cambyses consults his council (1–125) and there
is a banquet (965–1042) with a ‘boorde’, at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span> end of which order is
given to ‘take all these things away’.<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> In other episodes the Court
is ‘yonder’ (732, 938); it is only necessary to suppose that they were
played well away from the <i>domus</i>. One is in a ‘feeld so green’
(843–937), and a stage-direction tells us ‘Heere trace up and downe
playing’. In another (754–842) clowns are on their way to market.<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a>
The only other noteworthy point is that, not for the first nor for
the last time, a post upon the stage is utilized in the action.<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a>
<i>Patient Grissell</i>, on the other hand, requires two localities.
The more important is Salucia (Saluzzo), where are Gautier’s mansion,
Janickell’s cottage, and the house of Mother Apleyarde, a midwife
(1306). The other is Bullin Lagras (Bologna), where there are two short
episodes (1235–92, 1877–1900) at the house of the Countess of Pango.
There can be little doubt that all the <i>domus</i> were staged at
once. There is direct transfer of action from Gautier’s to the cottage
and back again (612–34; cf. 1719, 2042, 2090). Yet there is some little
distance between, for when a messenger is sent, the foreshortening of
space is indicated by the stage-direction (1835), ‘Go once or twise
about the Staige’.<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> Similarly, unless an ‘Exiunt’ has dropped out,
there is direct transfer (1900) from Bullin Lagras to Salucia. In
<i>Orestes</i> the problem of discrete localities is quite differently
handled. The play falls into five quasi-acts of unequal length, which
are situated successively at Mycenae, Crete, Mycenae, Athens, Mycenae.
For all, as in <i>Gorboduc</i>, the same sketchy palace background
might serve, with one interesting and prophetic exception. The middle
episodes (538–925), at Mycenae, afford the first example of those siege
scenes which the Shakespearian stage came to love. A messenger brings
warning to Aegisthus and Clytemnestra of the purpose of Orestes ‘to
inuade this Mycoene Citie stronge’. Aegisthus goes into the ‘realme’,
to take up men, and Clytemnestra will defend the city. There is a
quarrel between a soldier and a woman and the Vice sings a martial
song. Then ‘Horestes entrith with his bande and marcheth about the
stage’. He instructs a Herald, who advances with his trumpeter.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span> ‘Let
y<sup>e</sup> trumpet go towarde the Citie and blowe.’ Clytemnestra answers. ‘Let
y<sup>e</sup> trumpet leaue soundyng and let Harrauld speake and Clytemnestra
speake ouer y<sup>e</sup> wal.’ Summons and defiance follow, and Orestes calls
on his men for an assault. ‘Go and make your liuely battel and let it
be longe, eare you can win y<sup>e</sup> Citie, and when you haue won it, let
Horestes bringe out his mother by the armes, and let y<sup>e</sup> droum sease
playing and the trumpet also, when she is taken.’ But now Aegisthus
is at hand. ‘Let Egistus enter and set hys men in a raye, and let the
drom play tyll Horestes speaketh.’ There is more fighting, which ends
with the capture and hanging of Aegisthus. ‘Fling him of y<sup>e</sup> lader, and
then let on bringe in his mother Clytemnestra; but let her loke wher
Egistus hangeth’. Finally Orestes announces that ‘Enter now we wyll the
citie gate’. In the two other plays the changes of locality come thick
and fast. The action of <i>Clyomon and Clamydes</i> begins in Denmark,
and passes successively to Swabia, to the Forest of Marvels on the
borders of Macedonia, to the Isle of Strange Marshes twenty days’ sail
from Macedonia, to the Forest again, to the Isle again, to Norway, to
the Forest, to the Isle, to the Forest, to a road near Denmark, to the
Isle, to Denmark. Only two <i>domus</i> are needed, a palace (733) in
the Isle, and Bryan Sans Foy’s Castle in the Forest. This is a prison,
with a practicable door and a window, from which Clamydes speaks
(872). At one point Providence descends and ascends (1550–64). In one
of the Forest scenes a hearse is brought in and it is still there in
the next (1450, 1534), although a short Isle scene has intervened.
This looks as though the two ends of the stage may have been assigned
throughout to the two principal localities, the Forest and the Isle.
Some care is taken to let the speakers give the audience a clue
when a new locality is made use of for the first time. Afterwards
the recurrence of characters whom they had already seen would help
them. The Norway episode (1121) is the only one which need have much
puzzled them. But <i>Clyomon and Clamydes</i> may have made use of
a peculiar device, which becomes apparent in the stage-directions
of <i>Common Conditions</i>. The play opens in Arabia, where first
a spot near the Court and then a wood are indicated; but the latter
part alternates between Phrygia, near the sea-shore, and the Isle of
Marofus. No <i>domus</i> is necessary, and it must remain uncertain
whether the wood was represented by visualized trees. It is introduced
(295) with the stage-direction, ‘Here enter Sedmond with Clarisia and
Condicions out of the wood’. Similarly Phrygia is introduced (478)
with ‘Here entreth Galiarbus out of Phrygia’,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span> and a few lines later
(510) we get ‘Here enter Lamphedon out of Phrygia’. Now it is to be
noted that the episodes which follow these directions are not away
from, but in the wood and Phrygia respectively; and the inference
has been drawn that there were labelled doors, entrance through one
of which warned the spectators that action was about to take place
in the locality whose title the label bore.<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> This theory obtains
some plausibility from the use of the gates Homoloydes and Electrae
in <i>Jocasta</i>; and perhaps also from the inscribed house of the
<i>ruffiana</i> in Serlio’s <i>scena comica</i>, from the early Terence
engravings, and from certain examples of lettered <i>mansions</i> in
French miracle-plays.<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> But of course these analogies do not go
the whole way in support of a practice of using differently lettered
entrances to help out an imagined conversion of the same ‘place’ into
different localities. More direct confirmation may perhaps be derived
from Sidney’s criticism of the contemporary drama in his <i>Defence of
Poesie</i> (<i>c.</i> 1583). There are two passages to be cited.<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a>
The first forms part of an argument that poets are not liars. Their
feigning is a convention, and is accepted as such by their hearers.
‘What Childe is there’, says Sidney, ‘that, comming to a Play, and
seeing <i>Thebes</i> written in great letters vpon an olde doore, doth
beleeue that it is <i>Thebes</i>?’ Later on he deals more formally
with the stage, as a classicist, writing after the unity of place had
hardened into a doctrine. Even <i>Gorboduc</i> is no perfect tragedy.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘For it is faulty both in place and time, the two necessary
companions of all corporall actions. For where the stage
should alwaies represent but one place, and the vttermost time
presupposed in it should be, both by <i>Aristotles</i> precept
and common reason, but one day, there is both many dayes,
and many places, inartificially imagined. But if it be so in
<i>Gorboduck</i>, how much more in al the rest? where you shal
haue <i>Asia</i> of the one side, and <i>Affrick</i> of the
other, and so many other vnder-kingdoms, that the Player, when
he commeth in, must ever begin with telling where he is, or els
the tale wil not be conceiued. Now ye shal haue three ladies
walke to gather flowers, and then we must beleeue the stage to
be a Garden. By and by, we heare <span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>newes of shipwracke in the
same place, and then wee are to blame if we accept it not for a
Rock. Vpon the backe of that, comes out a hidious Monster, with
fire and smoke, and then the miserable beholders are bounde to
take it for a Caue. While in the meantime two Armies flye in,
represented with foure swords and bucklers, and then what harde
heart will not receiue it for a pitched fielde?’</p>
</div>

<p>It is evident that the plays which Sidney has mostly in mind, the
‘al the rest’ of his antithesis with <i>Gorboduc</i>, are precisely
those romantic histories which the noblemen’s players in particular
were bringing to Court in his day, and of which <i>Clyomon and
Clamydes</i> and <i>Common Conditions</i> may reasonably be taken as
the characteristic débris. He hints at what we might have guessed that,
where changes of scene were numerous, the actual visualization of the
different scenes left much to the imagination. He lays his finger upon
the foreshortening, which permits the two ends of the stage to stand
for localities separated by a considerable distance, and upon the
obligation which the players were under to let the opening phrases of
their dialogue make it clear where they were supposed to be situated.
And it certainly seems from the shorter passage, as if he was also
familiar with an alternative or supplementary device of indicating
locality by great letters on a door. The whole business remains rather
obscure. What happened if the distinct localities were more numerous
than the doors? Were the labels shifted, or were the players then
driven, as Sidney seems to suggest, to rely entirely upon the method
of spoken hints? The labelling of special doors with great letters
must be distinguished from the analogous use of great letters, as
at the <i>Phormio</i> of 1528, to publish the title of a play.<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a>
That this practice also survived in Court drama may be inferred from
Kyd’s <i>Spanish Tragedy</i>, in which Hieronimo gives a Court play,
and bids his assistant (<span class="allsmcap">IV.</span> iii. 17) ‘hang up the Title: Our
scene is Rhodes’. Even if the ‘scene’ formed part of the title in
such cases, it would only name a generalized locality or localities
for the play, and would not serve as a clue to the localization of
individual episodes.<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span> A retrospect over this discussion of Tudor
staging, which is mainly Court staging, up to a point well subsequent
to the establishment of the first regular theatres, seems to offer the
following results. The earliest interludes, other than revivals of
Plautus and Terence or elements in spectacular disguisings, limited
themselves to the setting of the hall in which they were performed,
with its doors, hearth, and furniture. In such conditions either
exterior or interior action could be indifferently represented. This
arrangement, however, soon ceased to satisfy, in the Court at any rate,
the sixteenth-century love of decoration; and one or more houses were
introduced into the background, probably on a Renaissance rather than
a mediaeval suggestion, through which, as well as the undifferentiated
doors, the personages could come and go. The addition of an elevated
stage enabled traps to be used (<i>All for Money</i>, <i>Gorboduc</i>,
<i>Jocasta</i>, <i>Gismond of Salerne</i>, <i>Arraignment of
Paris</i>); but here, as in the corresponding device of a descent
from above (<i>Gismond of Salerne</i>, <i>Clyomon and Clamydes</i>),
it is the mediaeval grading for heaven and hell which lies behind the
Renaissance usage. With houses in the background, the normal action
becomes uniformly exterior. If a visit is paid to a house, conversation
takes place at its door rather than within. The exceptions are rare and
tentative, amounting to little more than the provision of a shallow
recess within a house, from which personages, usually one or two
only, can speak. This may be a window (<i>Two Italian Gentlemen</i>,
<i>Promos and Cassandra</i>), a prison (<i>Wit and Wisdom</i>,
<i>Promos and Cassandra</i>, <i>Clyomon and Clamydes</i>), a bower
(<i>Misogonus</i>, <i>Endymion</i>, <i>Dido</i>, <i>Arraignment of
Paris</i>), a tub (<i>Campaspe</i>), a shrine or tomb (<i>Two Italian
Gentlemen</i>, <i>Promos and Cassandra</i>), a shop (<i>Thersites</i>,
<i>Promos and Cassandra</i>, <i>Campaspe</i>, <i>Sapho and Phao</i>),
a bedchamber (<i>Gismund of Salerne</i>, <i>Tom Tyler</i>, <i>Sapho
and Phao</i>). Somewhat more difficulty is afforded by episodes
in which there is a banquet (<i>Mary Magdalene</i>, <i>Dido</i>,
<i>Cambyses</i>), or a law court (<i>Conflict of Conscience</i>), or
a king confers with his councillors (<i>Midas</i>, <i>Cambyses</i>).
These, according to modern notions, require the setting of a hall; but
my impression is that the Italianized imagination of the Elizabethans
was content<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span> to accept them as taking place more or less out-of-doors,
on the steps or in the cortile of a palace, with perhaps some arcaded
<i>loggia</i>, such as Serlio suggests, in the background, which would
be employed when the action was supposed to be withdrawn from the
public market-place or street. And this convention I believe to have
lasted well into the Shakespearian period.<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a></p>

<p>The simplicity of this scheme of staging is broken into, when a
mediaeval survival or the popular instinct for storytelling faces
the producer with a plot incapable of continuous presentation in
a single locality. A mere foreshortening of the distance between
houses conceived as surrounding one and the same open <i>platea</i>,
or as dispersed in the same wood, is hardly felt as a breach of
unity. But the principle is endangered, when action within a city is
diversified by one or more ‘approach’ episodes, in which the edge
of the stage or the steps leading up to it must stand for a road or
a wood in the environs (<i>Promos and Cassandra</i>, <i>Sapho and
Phao</i>, <i>Dido</i>). It is on the point of abandonment, when the
foreshortening is carried so far that one end of the stage represents
one locality and the other end another at a distance (<i>Disobedient
Child</i>, <i>Mary Magdalene</i>, <i>Endymion</i>, <i>Midas</i>,
<i>Patient Grissell</i>). And it has been abandoned altogether, when
the same background or a part of it is taken to represent different
localities in different episodes, and ingenuity has to be taxed to
find means of informing the audience where any particular bit of
action is proceeding (<i>Gorboduc</i>, <i>Orestes</i>, <i>Clyomon and
Clamydes</i>, <i>Common Conditions</i>).<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a></p>

<p>After considering the classicist group of comedies and tragedies, I
suggested that these, taken by themselves, would point to a method of
staging at the Elizabethan Court not unlike that recommended by Serlio.
The more comprehensive survey now completed points to some revision
of that judgement. Two localities at opposite ends of the stage could
not, obviously, be worked into a continuous architectural façade. They
call for something more on the lines of the multiple setting of the
Hôtel de Bourgogne, although the width of the Elizabethan palace halls
may perhaps have accommodated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span> a longer stage than that of the Hôtel,
and permitted of a less crude juxtaposition of the houses belonging to
distinct localities than Mahelot offers us. Any use of perspective, for
which there is some Elizabethan evidence, was presumably within the
limits of one locality.<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a></p>

<p>The indications of the Revels Accounts, scanty as they are, are
not inconsistent with those yielded by the plays.<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> If the
<i>Orestes</i> of 1567–8, as may reasonably be supposed, was
Pikeryng’s, his ‘howse’ must have been the common structure used
successively for Mycenae, Crete, and Athens. The ‘Scotland and a gret
Castell on thothere side’ give us the familiar arrangement for two
localities. I think that the ‘city’ of the later accounts may stand
for a group of houses on one street or market-place, and a ‘mountain’
or ‘wood’ for a setting <i>tout en pastoralle</i>. There were tents
for <i>A Game of the Cards</i> in 1582–3, as in <i>Jacob and Esau</i>,
a prison for <i>The Four Sons of Fabius</i> in 1579–80, as in several
extant plays. I cannot parallel from any early survival the senate
house for the <i>Quintus Fabius</i> of 1573–4, but this became a
common type of scene at a later date. These are recessed houses, and
curtains, quite distinct from the front curtain, if any, were provided
by the Revels officers to open and close them, as the needs of the
action required. Smaller structures, to which the accounts refer,
are also needed by the plays; a well by <i>Endymion</i>, a gibbet
by <i>Orestes</i>, a tree by <i>The Arraignment of Paris</i>, and
inferentially by all pastoral, and many other plays. The brief record
of 1567–8 does not specify the battlement or gated wall, solid enough
for Clytemnestra to speak ‘ouer y<sup>e</sup> wal’, which was a feature in the
siege episode of <i>Orestes</i>. Presumably it was part of the ‘howse’,
which is mentioned, and indeed it would by itself furnish sufficient
background for the scenes alike at Mycenae, Crete, and Athens. If it
stood alone, it probably extended along the back of the stage, where
it would interfere least with the arrays of Orestes and of Aegisthus.
But in the accounts of 1579–85, the plays, of which there are many,
with battlements also, as a rule, have cities, and here we must suppose
some situation for the battlement which will not interfere with the
city. If it stood for the gate and wall of some other city, it may
have been reared at an opposite end of the stage. In <i>Dido</i>,
where the gate of Troy seems to have been shown, although there is
no action ‘ouer’ it, I can visualize it best as extending across the
middle of the stage from back to front. With an unchanging setting it
need not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span> always have occupied the same place. The large number of
plays between 1579 and 1585 which required battlements, no less than
fourteen out of twenty-eight in all, is rather striking. No doubt the
assault motive was beloved in the popular type of drama, of which
<i>Orestes</i> was an early representative. A castle in a wood, where a
knight is imprisoned, is assaulted in <i>Clyomon and Clamydes</i>, and
the Shakespearian stage never wearied of the device. I have sometimes
thought that with the Revels officers ‘battlement’ was a technical
term for any platform provided for action at a higher level than the
floor of the stage. Certainly a battlement was provided in 1585 for
an entertainment which was not a play at all, but a performance of
feats of activities.<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> But as a matter of fact raised action, so
common in the Shakespearian period, is extremely rare in these early
plays. With the exceptions of Clytemnestra peering over her wall, and
the descents from heaven in <i>Gismond of Salerne</i> and <i>Clyomon
and Clamydes</i>, which may of course have been through the roof
rather than from a platform, the seventy or so plays just discussed
contain nothing of the kind. There are, however, two plays still to
be mentioned, in which use is made of a platform, and one of these
gives some colour to my suggestion. In 1582 Derby’s men played <i>Love
and Fortune</i> at Court, and a city and a battlement, together with
some other structure of canvas, the name of which is left blank, were
provided. This may reasonably be identified with the <i>Rare Triumphs
of Love and Fortune</i>, which claims on its title-page of 1589 to have
been played before the Queen. It is a piece of the romantic type. The
action is divided between a court and a cave in a wood, which account
for the city and the unnamed structure of the Revels record. They were
evidently shown together, at opposite ends of the stage, for action
passes directly from one to the other. There is no assault scene. But
there is an induction, in which the gods are in assembly, and Tisiphone
arises from hell. At the end of it Jupiter says to Venus and Fortune:</p>

    </div>
  </div>

<p>They remain as spectators of the play until they ‘shew themselves’ and
intervene in the <i>dénouement</i>. Evidently they are in a raised
place or balcony. And this balcony must be the battlement. An exact
analogy is furnished by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span> the one of Lyly’s plays to which I have not as
yet referred. This is <i>The Woman in the Moon</i>, Lyly’s only verse
play, and possibly of later date than his group of productions with the
Paul’s boys. The first act has the character of an induction. Nature
and the seven Planets are on the stage and ‘They draw the curtins from
before Natures shop’. During the other four there is a human action in
a pastoral setting with a cave, beneath which is a trap, a grove on the
bank of Enipeus, and a spot near the sea-shore. And throughout one or
other of the Planets is watching the play from a ‘seate’ (<span class="allsmcap">II.</span>

<h3>XX<br />
<span class="subhed">STAGING IN THE THEATRES: SIXTEENTH CENTURY</span></h3></div>

<p class="center sm">[For <i>Bibliographical Note</i>, <i>vide</i> ch. xviii.]</p>


<p>In dealing with the groups of plays brought under review in the
last chapter, the main problem considered has been that of their
adaptability to the conditions of a Court stage. In the present chapter
the point of view must be shifted to that of the common theatres.
Obviously no hard and fast line is to be drawn. There had been regular
public performances in London since the beginning of Elizabeth’s reign
or earlier, and there is no reason to suppose that the adult companies
at least did not draw upon the same repertory both for popular and for
private representation. But there is not much profit in attempting
to investigate the methods of staging in the inns, of which we know
nothing more than that quasi-permanent structures of carpenter’s work
came in time to supplement the doors, windows, and galleries which
surrounded the yards; and so far as the published plays go, it is
fairly apparent that, up to the date of the suppression of Paul’s, the
Court, or at any rate the private, interest was the dominating one. A
turning-point may be discerned in 1576, at the establishment, on the
one hand of the Theatre and the Curtain, and on the other of Farrant’s
house in the Blackfriars. It is not likely that the Blackfriars
did more than reproduce the conditions of a courtly hall. But the
investment of capital in the Theatre and the Curtain was an incident
in the history of the companies, the economic importance of which has
already been emphasized in an earlier discussion.<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> It was followed
by the formation of strong theatrical organizations in the Queen’s men,
the Admiral’s, Strange’s, the Chamberlain’s. For a time the economic
changes are masked by the continued vogue of the boy companies; but
when these dropped out at the beginning of the ’nineties, it is clear
that the English stage had become a public stage, and that the eyes of
its controllers were fixed primarily upon the pence gathered by the
box-holders, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span> only secondarily upon the rewards of the Treasurer of
the Chamber.</p>

<p>The first play published ‘as it was publikely acted’ is the
<i>Troublesome Raigne of John</i> of 1591, and henceforward I think
it is true to say that the staging suggested by the public texts and
their directions in the main represents the arrangements of the public
theatres. There is no sudden breach of continuity with the earlier
period, but that continuity is far greater with the small group of
popular plays typified by <i>Clyomon and Clamydes</i> and <i>Common
Conditions</i>, than with anything which Lyly and his friends produced
at Paul’s or the Blackfriars. Again it is necessary to beware of any
exaggeration of antithesis. There is one Chapel play, <i>The Wars of
Cyrus</i>, the date of which is obscure, and the setting of which
certainly falls on the theatre rather than the Court side of any
border-line. On the other hand, the Queen’s men and their successors
continued to serve the Court, and one of the published Queen’s plays,
<i>The Old Wive’s Tale</i>, was evidently staged in a way exactly
analogous to that adopted by Lyly, or by Peele himself in <i>The
Arraignment of Paris</i>. It is <i>tout en pastoralle</i>, and about
the stage are dispersed a hut with a door, at the threshold of which
presenters sit to watch the main action (71, 128, 1163), a little hill
or mound with a practicable turf (512, 734, 1034), a cross (173, 521),
a ‘well of life’ (743, 773), an inn before which a table is set (904,
916), and a ‘cell’ or ‘studie’ for the conjurer, before which ‘he
draweth a curten’ (411, 773, 1060).<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> Of one other play by Peele it
is difficult to take any account in estimating evidence as to staging.
This is <i>David and Bethsabe</i>, of which the extant text apparently
represents an attempt to bring within the compass of a single
performance a piece or fragments of a piece originally written in three
‘discourses’. I mention it here, because somewhat undue use has been
made of its opening direction in speculations as to the configuration
of the back wall of the public stage.<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> It uses the favourite
assault motive, and has many changes of locality. The title-page
suggests that in its present form it was meant for public performance.
But almost anything may lie behind that present form, possibly a
Chapel play, possibly a University play, or even a neo-miracle in the
tradition of Bale; and the staging of any particular scene<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span> may contain
original elements, imperfectly adapted to later conditions.</p>

<p>Counting in <i>The Wars of Cyrus</i> then, and counting out <i>The
Old Wive’s Tale</i> and <i>David and Bethsabe</i>, there are about
seventy-four plays which may reasonably be taken to have been presented
upon common stages, between the establishment of the Queen’s men
in 1583 and the building of the Globe for the Chamberlain’s men in
1599 and of the Fortune for the Admiral’s men in 1600. With a few
exceptions they were also published during the same period, and the
scenic arrangements implied by their texts and stage-directions may
therefore be looked upon as those of the sixteenth-century theatres.
These form the next group for our consideration. Of the seventy-four
plays, the original production of nine may with certainty or fair
probability be assigned to the Queen’s men, of two to Sussex’s, five
to Pembroke’s, fourteen to Strange’s or the Admiral’s or the two in
combination, thirteen to the Admiral’s after the combination broke up,
seventeen to the Chamberlain’s, three to Derby’s, one to Oxford’s,
and one to the Chapel; nine must remained unassigned.<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> It is far
less easy to make a guess at the individual theatre whose staging
each play represents. The migrations of the companies before 1594 in
the main elude us. Thereafter the Admiral’s were settled at the Rose
until 1600. The Chamberlain’s may have passed from the Theatre to
the Curtain about 1597. The habitations of the other later companies
are very conjectural. Moreover, plays were carried<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span> from theatre
to theatre, and even transferred from company to company. <i>Titus
Andronicus</i>, successively presented by Pembroke’s, Strange’s,
Sussex’s, and the Chamberlain’s, is an extreme case in point. The
ideal method would have been to study the staging of each theatre
separately, before coming to any conclusion as to the similarity or
diversity of their arrangements. This is impracticable, and I propose
therefore to proceed on the assumption that the stages of the Theatre,
the Curtain, and the Rose were in their main features similar. For
this there is an <i>a priori</i> argument in the convenience of what
Mr. Archer calls a ‘standardisation of effects’, especially at a time
when the bonds between companies and theatres were so loose.<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a>
Moreover, the Theatre and the Curtain were built at much the same date,
and although there was room for development in the art of theatrical
architecture before the addition of the Rose, I am unable, after a
careful examination of the relevant plays, to lay my finger upon any
definite new feature which Henslowe can be supposed to have introduced.
It is exceedingly provoking that the sixteenth-century repertory of the
Swan has yielded nothing which can serve as a <i>point de liaison</i>
between De Witt’s drawing and the mass of extant texts.</p>

<p>It will be well to begin with some analysis of the various types of
scene which the sixteenth-century managers were called upon to produce;
and these may with advantage be arranged according to the degree of
use which they make of a structural background.<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> There are, of
course, a certain number of scenes which make no use of a background
at all, and may in a sense be called unlocated scenes&mdash;mere bits of
conversation which might be carried on between the speakers wherever
they happened to meet, and which give no indication of where that
meeting is supposed to be. Perhaps these scenes are not so numerous as
is sometimes suggested.<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> At any rate it must be borne in mind that
they were located<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span> to the audience, who saw them against a background,
although, if they were kept well to the front or side of the stage,
their relation to that background would be minimized.</p>

<p>A great many scenes are in what may be called open country&mdash;in a
road, a meadow, a grove, a forest, a desert, a mountain, a sea-shore.
The personages are travelling, or hunting, or in outlawry, or merely
taking the air. The background does not generally include a house in
the stricter sense; but there may be a cottage,<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> a hermit’s or
friar’s cell,<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> a rustic bower,<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> a cave,<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> a beacon.<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a>
Even where there is no evidence, in dialogue or stage-directions,
for a dwelling, a table or board may be suddenly forthcoming for a
banquet.<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> There may be a fountain or well,<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> and a few scenes
seem to imply the presence of a river.<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> But often there is no
suggestion of any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span> surroundings but rocks or trees, and the references
to the landscape, which are frequently put in the mouths of speakers,
have been interpreted as intended to stimulate the imagination of
spectators before whose eyes no representation, or a very imperfect
representation, of wilderness or woodland had been placed.<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> But
it is not likely that this literary artifice was alone relied upon,
and in some cases practicable trees or rocks are certainly required
by the action and must have been represented.<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> There are plays
which are set continuously in the open country throughout, or during a
succession of scenes, and are thus analogous to Court plays <i>tout en
pastoralle</i>. But there are others in which the open-country scenes
are only interspersed among scenes of a different type.<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a></p>

<p>Nothing was more beloved by a popular audience, especially in an
historical play or one of the <i>Tamburlaine</i> order, than an episode
of war. A war scene was often only a variety of the open-country scene.
Armies come and go on the road, and a battle naturally takes place in
more or less open ground. It may be in a wood, or a tree or river may
be introduced.<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> Obviously large forces could not be shown on the
stage.</p>

<p class="p-left">The actual fighting tended to be sketchy and symbolical. There were
alarums and excursions, much beating of drums and blowing of trumpets.
But the stage was often only on the outskirts of the main battle.<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a>
It served for a duel of protagonists, or for a flight and pursuit of
stragglers; and when all was over a triumphant train marched across
it. There may be a succession of ‘excursions’ of this kind, in which
the stage may be supposed, if you like, to stand for different parts
of a battle-field.<a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> Battle scenes have little need for background;
the inn at St. Albans in <i>Henry VI</i> is an exception due to the
fulfilment of an oracular prophecy.<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> A more natural indication of
<i>milieu</i> is a tent, and battle scenes merge into camp scenes,
in which the tents are sometimes elaborate pavilions, with doors and
even locks to the doors. Seats and tables may be available, and the
action is clearly sometimes within an opened tent.<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> Two opposing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
camps can be concurrently represented, and action may alternate
between them.<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> Another kind of background is furnished, as in
<i>Orestes</i>, by the walls of a besieged city. On these walls the
defenders can appear and parley with the besieging host. They can
descend and open the gates.<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> They can shoot, and be shot at from
below.<a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> The walls can be taken by assault and the defenders can
leap from them.<a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> Such scenes had an unfailing appeal, and are
sometimes repeated, before different cities, in the same play.<a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span></p>

<p>Several scenes, analogous in some ways to those in the open country,
are set in a garden, an orchard, a park. These also sometimes utilize
tents.<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> Alternative shelter may be afforded by an arbour or bower,
which facilitates eavesdropping.<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span> The presence of trees, banks, or
herbs is often required or suggested.<a id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> As a rule, the neighbourhood
of a dwelling is implied, and from this personages may issue, or may
hold discourse with those outside. Juliet’s balcony, overlooking
Capulet’s orchard, is a typical instance.<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> A banquet may be brought
out and served in the open.<a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a></p>

<p>The next great group of scenes consists of those which pass in some
public spot in a city&mdash;in a street, a market-place, or a churchyard.
Especially if the play is located in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span> or near London, this may be
a definite and familiar spot&mdash;Cheapside, Lombard Street, Paul’s
Churchyard, Westminster.<a id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> Often the action is self-sufficient and
the background merely suggestive or decorative. A procession passes;
a watch is set; friends meet and converse; a stranger asks his way.
But sometimes a structure comes into use. There is a scaffold for an
execution.<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> Lists are set, and there must be at least a raised
place for the judge, and probably a barrier.<a id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> One street scene
in <i>Soliman and Perseda</i> is outside a tiltyard; another close
to an accessible tower.<a id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> Bills may be set up.<a id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> In <i>Lord
Cromwell</i> this is apparently done on a bridge, and twice in this
play it is difficult to resist the conclusion, already<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span> pointed to in
certain open-country scenes, that some kind of representation of a
river-side was feasible.<a id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> In Rome there are scenes in which the
dialogue is partly amongst senators in the capitol and partly amongst
citizens within ear-shot outside.<a id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> A street may provide a corner,
again, whence passers-by can be overheard or waylaid.<a id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> And in it,
just as well as in a garden, a lover may hold an assignation, or bring
a serenade before the window of his mistress.<a id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> A churchyard,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span> or in
a Roman play a market-place, may hold a tomb.<a id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> Finally one or more
shops may be visible, and action may take place within them as well as
before them.<a id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> Such a shop would, of course, be nothing more than a
shallow stall, with an open front for the display of wares, which may
be closed by a shutter or flap from above.<a id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> It may also, like the
inn in <i>Henry VI</i>, have a sign.<a id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a></p>

<p>Where there is a window, there can of course be a door, and street
scenes very readily become threshold scenes. I do not think that it
has been fully realized how large a proportion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span> of the action of
Elizabethan plays passes at the doors of houses; and as a result
the problem of staging, difficult enough anyhow, has been rendered
unnecessarily difficult. Here we have probably to thank the editors
of plays, who have freely interspersed their texts with notes of
locality, which are not in the original stage-directions, and, with
eighteenth-century models before them, have tended to assume that
action at a house is action in some room within that house. The
playwrights, on the other hand, followed the neo-classic Italian
tradition, and for them action at a house was most naturally action
before the door of that house. If a man visited his friend he was
almost certain to meet him on the doorstep; and here domestic
discussions, even on matters of delicacy, commonly took place. Here
too, of course, meals might be served.<a id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> A clue to this convention
is afforded by the numerous passages in which a servant or other
personage is brought on to the stage by a ‘Who’s within?’ or a call
to ‘Come forth!’ or in which an episode is wound up by some such
invitation as ‘Let us in!’ No doubt such phrases remain appropriate
when it is merely a question of transference between an outer room
and an inner; and no doubt also the point of view of the personages
is sometimes deflected by that of the actors, to whom ‘in’ means ‘in
the tiring-room’ and ‘out’ means ‘on the stage’.<a id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> But, broadly
speaking, the frequency of their use points to a corresponding
frequency of threshold scenes; and, where there is a doubt, they
should, I think, be interpreted in the light of that economy of
interior action which was very evident in the mid-sixteenth-century
plays, and in my opinion continued to prevail after the opening
of the theatres. The use of a house door was so frequent that the
stage-directions do not, as a rule, trouble to specify it.<a id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> Two
complications are, however, to be observed.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span> Sometimes, in a scene
which employs the ‘Let us in!’ formula, or on other ground looks like
a threshold scene, we are suddenly pulled up either by a suggestion
of the host that we are ‘in’ his house or under his roof, or by an
indication that persons outside are to be brought ‘in’.<a id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> The first
answer is, I think, that the threshold is not always a mere doorstep
opening from the street; it may be something of the nature of a porch
or even a lobby, and that you may fairly be said to be under a man’s
roof when you are in his porch.<a id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> The second is that in some
threshold scenes the stage was certainly regarded as representing a
courtyard, shut off from the street or road by an outer gate, through
which strangers could quite properly be supposed to come ‘in’.<a id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a>
Such courtyard scenes are not out of place, even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span> before an ordinary
private house; still less, of course, when the house is a castle, and
in a castle courtyard scene we get very near the scenes with ‘walls’
already described.<a id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> Some prison scenes, in the Tower or elsewhere,
are apparently of this type, although others seem to require interior
action in a close chamber or even a dungeon.<a id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> Threshold scenes may
also be before the outer gate of a palace or castle, where another
analogy to assault scenes presents itself;<a id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> or before a church or
temple, a friar’s cell, an inn, a stable, or the like.<a id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> Nor are
shop scenes, since a shop may be a mere adjunct to a house, really
different in kind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span></p>

<p>The threshold theory must not be pushed to a disregard of the clear
evidence for a certain amount of interior action. We have already come
across examples of shallow recesses, such as a tent, a cave, a bower, a
tomb, a shop, a window, within which, or from within which, personages
can speak. There are also scenes which must be supposed to take
place within a room. In dealing with these, I propose to distinguish
between spacious hall scenes and limited chamber scenes. Hall scenes
are especially appropriate to palaces. Full value should no doubt be
given to the extension in a palace of a porch to a portico, and to the
convention, which kings as well as private men follow in Elizabethan
plays, especially those located in Italian or Oriental surroundings, of
transacting much important business more or less out-of-doors.<a id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> The
characteristic Roman ‘senate house’, already described, is a case in
point.<a id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> But some scenes must be in a closed presence-chamber.<a id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a>
Others are in a formal council room or parliament house. The conception
of a hall, often with a numerous company, cannot therefore be
altogether excluded. Nor are halls confined to palaces. They must be
assumed for law courts.<a id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> There are scenes in such buildings as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
London Exchange, Leadenhall, the Regent House at Oxford.<a id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> There
are scenes in churches or heathen temples and in monasteries.<a id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a>
There are certainly also hall scenes in castles or private houses,
and it is sometimes a matter of taste whether you assume a hall scene
or a threshold scene.<a id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> Certain features of hall scenes may be
enumerated. Personages can go into, or come forth from, an inner room.
They can be brought in from without.<a id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> Seats are available, and
a chair or ‘state’ for a sovereign.<a id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> A law court has its ‘bar’.
Banquets can be served.<a id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> Masks<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span> may come dancing in.<a id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> Even a
play ‘within a play’ can be presented; that of Bottom and his fellows
in ‘the great chamber’ of Theseus’ palace is an example.<a id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a></p>

<p>My final group is formed by the chamber scenes, in which the action
is clearly regarded as within the limits of an ordinary room. They
are far from numerous, in proportion to the total number of scenes in
the seventy-three plays, and in view of their importance in relation
to staging all for which there is clear evidence must be put upon
record. Most of them fall under two or three sub-types, which tend to
repeat themselves. The commonest are perhaps bedchamber scenes.<a id="FNanchor_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a>
These, like prison scenes, which are also frequent,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span> give opportunity
for tragic episodes of death and sickness.<a id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span> There are scenes
in living-rooms, often called ‘studies’.<a id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span> A lady’s bower,<a id="FNanchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a>
a counting-house,<a id="FNanchor_194" href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> an inn parlour,<a id="FNanchor_195" href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> a buttery,<a id="FNanchor_196" href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> a
gallery,<a id="FNanchor_197" href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> may also be represented.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span></p>

<p>This then is the practical problem, which the manager of an Elizabethan
theatre had to solve&mdash;the provision of settings,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span> not necessarily
so elaborate or decorative as those of the Court, but at least
intelligible, for open country scenes, battle and siege scenes, garden
scenes, street and threshold scenes, hall scenes, chamber scenes. Like
the Master of the Revels, he made far less use of interior action
than the modern or even the Restoration producer of plays; but he
could not altogether avoid it, either on the larger scale of a hall
scene, in which a considerable number of persons had occasionally to
be staged for a parliament or a council or the like, or on the smaller
scale when only a few persons had to be shown in a chamber, or in
the still shallower enclosure which might stand as part of a mainly
out-of-doors setting for a cell, a bower, a cave, a tent, a senate
house, a window, a tomb, a shop, a porch, a shrine, a niche.<a id="FNanchor_198" href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> Even
more than the Master of the Revels, he had to face the complication
due to the taste of an English audience for romantic or historical
drama, and the changes of locality which a narrative theme inevitably
involved. Not for him, except here and there in a comedy, that blessed
unity of place upon which the whole dramatic art of the Italian
neo-classic school had been built up. Our corresponding antiquarian
problem is to reconstruct, so far as the evidence permits, the
structural resources which were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span> at the Elizabethan manager’s disposal
for the accomplishment of his task. As material we have the numerous
indications in dialogue and stage-directions with which the footnotes
to this chapter are groaning; we have such contemporary allusions as
those of Dekker’s <i>Gull’s Hornbook</i>; we have the débris of Philip
Henslowe’s business memoranda; we have the tradition inherited from the
earlier Elizabethan period, for all the types of scene usual in the
theatres had already made their appearance before the theatres came
into existence; to a much less degree, owing to the interposition of
the roofed and rectangular Caroline theatre, we have also the tradition
bequeathed to the Restoration; and as almost sole graphic presentment
we have that drawing of the Swan theatre by Johannes de Witt, which
has already claimed a good deal of our consideration, and to which we
shall have to return from time to time, as a <i>point de repère</i>, in
the course of the forthcoming discussion. It is peculiarly unfortunate
that of all the seventy-three plays, now under review, not one can be
shown to have been performed at the Swan, and that the only relics of
the productions at that house, the plot of <i>England’s Joy</i> of
1602 and Middleton’s <i>Chaste Maid in Cheapside</i> of 1611, stand
at such a distance of time from DeWitt’s drawing as not to exclude
the hypothesis of an intermediate reconstruction of its stage. One
other source of information, which throws a sidelight or two upon the
questions at issue, I will here deal with at more length, because it
has been a good deal overlooked. The so-called ‘English Wagner Book’
of 1594, which contains the adventures of Wagner after the death of
his master Faustus, although based upon a German original, is largely
an independent work by an author who shows more than one sign of
familiarity with the English theatre.<a id="FNanchor_199" href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> The most important of these
is in chapter viii, which is headed ‘The Tragedy of Doctor Faustus
seene in the Ayre, and acted in the presence of a thousand people of
Wittenberg. An. 1540’. It describes, not an actual performance, but an
aerial vision produced by Wagner’s magic arts for the bewilderment of
an imperial pursuivant. The architecture has therefore, no doubt, its
elements of fantasy. Nevertheless,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span> it is our nearest approach to a pen
picture of an Elizabethan stage, whereby to eke out that of De Witt’s
pencil.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘They might distinctly perceiue a goodlye Stage to be reard
(shining to sight like the bright burnish golde) uppon many a
faire Pillar of clearest Cristall, whose feete rested uppon the
Arch of the broad Raynebow, therein was the high Throne wherein
the King should sit, and that prowdly placed with two and twenty
degrees to the top, and round about curious wrought chaires for
diverse other Potentates, there might you see the ground-worke
at the one end of the Stage whereout the personated divels
should enter in their fiery ornaments, made like the broad wide
mouth of an huge Dragon ... the teeth of this Hels-mouth far
out stretching.... At the other end in opposition was seene the
place where in the bloudlesse skirmishes are so often perfourmed
on the Stage, the Wals ... of ... Iron attempered with the most
firme steele ... environed with high and stately Turrets of the
like metall and beautye, and hereat many in-gates and out-gates:
out of each side lay the bended Ordinaunces, showing at their
wide hollowes the crueltye of death: out of sundry loopes many
large Banners and Streamers were pendant, brieflye nothing was
there wanting that might make it a faire Castle. There might you
see to be short the Gibbet, the Posts, the Ladders, the tiring-house,
there everything which in the like houses either use or
necessity makes common. Now above all was there the gay Clowdes
<i>Vsque quaque</i> adorned with the heavenly firmament, and
often spotted with golden teares which men callen Stars. There
was lively portrayed the whole Imperiall Army of the faire
heavenly inhabitaunts.... This excellent faire Theator erected,
immediatly after the third sound of the Trumpets, there entreth
in the Prologue attired in a blacke vesture, and making his
three obeysances, began to shew the argument of that Scenicall
Tragedy, but because it was so far off they could not understand
the wordes, and having thrice bowed himselfe to the high Throne,
presently vanished.’</p>
</div>

<p>The action of the play is then described. Devils issue from hell mouth
and besiege the castle. Faustus appears on the battlements and defies
them. Angels descend from heaven to the tower and are dismissed by
Faustus. The devils assault the castle, capture Faustus and raze the
tower. The great devil and all the imperial rulers of hell occupy the
throne and chairs and dispute with Faustus. Finally,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘Faustus ... leapt down headlong of the stage, the whole company
immediatly vanishing, but the stage with a most monstrous
thundering crack followed Faustus hastely, the people verily
thinking that they would have fallen uppon them ran all away.’</p>
</div>

<p>The three salient features of the Swan stage, as depicted by De Witt,
are, firstly the two pairs of folding doors in the back wall; secondly,
the ‘heavens’ supported on posts, which give the effect of a division
of the space into a covered rear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span> and an uncovered front; and thirdly,
the gallery or row of boxes, which occupies the upper part of the back
wall. Each of these lends itself to a good deal of comment. The two
doors find abundant confirmation from numerous stage-directions, which
lead up to the favourite dramatic device of bringing in personages from
different points to meet in the centre of the stage. The formula which
agrees most closely with the drawing is that which directs entrance
‘at one door’ and ‘at the other door’, and is of very common use.<a id="FNanchor_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a>
But there are a great many variants, which are used, as for example in
the plot of <i>2 Seven Deadly Sins</i>, with such indifference as to
suggest that no variation of structure is necessarily involved.<a id="FNanchor_201" href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a>
Thus an equally common antithesis is that between ‘one door’ and, not
‘the other door’, but ‘an other door’.<a id="FNanchor_202" href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> Other analogous expressions
are ‘one way’ and ‘at an other door’, ‘one way’ and ‘another way’,
‘at two sundry doors’, ‘at diverse doors’, ‘two ways’, ‘met by’;<a id="FNanchor_203" href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a>
or again, ‘at several doors’, ‘several ways’, ‘severally’.<a id="FNanchor_204" href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> There
is a divergence, however, from De Witt’s indications, when we come
upon terminology which suggests that more than two doors may have
been available for entrances, a possibility with which the references
to ‘one door’ and ‘an other’ are themselves not inconsistent. Thus
in one of the <i>2 Seven Deadly Sins</i> variants, after other
personages have entered ‘seuerall waies’, we find ‘Gorboduk entreing
in the midst between’. There are other examples of triple entrance in
<i>Fair Em</i>, in <i>Patient Grissell</i>, and in <i>The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span> Trial of
Chivalry</i>, although it is not until the seventeenth century that
three doors are in so many words enumerated.<a id="FNanchor_205" href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> We get entrance ‘at
every door’, however, in <i>The Downfall of Robin Hood</i>, and this,
with other more disputable phrases, might perhaps be pressed into an
argument that even three points of entrance did not exhaust the limits
of practicability.<a id="FNanchor_206" href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> It should be added that, while doors are most
commonly indicated as the avenue of entrance, this is not always the
case. Sometimes personages are said to enter from one or other ‘end’,
or ‘side’, or ‘part’ of the stage.<a id="FNanchor_207" href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> I take it that the three terms
have the same meaning, and that the ‘end’ of a stage wider than its
depth is what we should call its ‘side’. A few minor points about doors
may be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span> noted, and the discussion of a difficulty may be deferred.<a id="FNanchor_208" href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a>
Some entrances were of considerable size; an animal could be ridden on
and off.<a id="FNanchor_209" href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> There were practicable and fairly solid doors; in <i>A
Knack to Know an Honest Man</i>, a door is taken off its hinges.<a id="FNanchor_210" href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a>
And as the doors give admittance indifferently to hall scenes and
to out-of-door scenes, it is obvious that the term, as used in the
stage-directions, often indicates a part of the theatrical structure
rather than a feature properly belonging to a garden or woodland
background.<a id="FNanchor_211" href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a></p>

<p>Some observations upon the heavens have already been made in an earlier
chapter.<a id="FNanchor_212" href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> I feel little doubt that, while the supporting posts
had primarily a structural object, and probably formed some obstacle
to the free vision of the spectators, they were occasionally worked
by the ingenuity of the dramatists and actors into the ‘business’ of
the plays. The hints for such business are not very numerous, but
they are sufficient to confirm the view that the Swan was not the
only sixteenth-century theatre in which the posts existed. Thus in a
street scene of <i>Englishmen for my Money</i> and in an open country
scene of <i>Two Angry Women of Abingdon</i> we get episodes in which
personages groping in the darkness stumble up against posts, and the
second of these is particularly illuminating, because the victim
utters a malediction upon the carpenter who set the post up, which a
carpenter may have done upon the stage, but certainly did not do in
a coney burrow.<a id="FNanchor_213" href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> In <i>Englishmen for my Money</i> the posts are
taken for maypoles, and there are two of them. There<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span> are two of them
also in <i>Three Lords and Three Ladies of London</i>, a post and ‘the
contrarie post’, and to one of them a character is bound, just as
Kempe tells us that pickpockets taken in a theatre were bound.<a id="FNanchor_214" href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a>
The binding to a post occurs also in <i>Soliman and Perseda</i>.<a id="FNanchor_215" href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a>
In <i>James IV</i> and in <i>Lord Cromwell</i> bills are set up on the
stage, and for this purpose the posts would conveniently serve.<a id="FNanchor_216" href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a>
All these are out-of-door scenes, but there was a post in the middle
of a warehouse in <i>Every Man In his Humour</i>, and Miles sits down
by a post during one of the scenes in the conjurer’s cell in <i>Bacon
and Bungay</i>.<a id="FNanchor_217" href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> I am not oblivious of the fact that there were
doubtless other structural posts on the stage besides those of the
heavens, but I do not see how they can have been so conspicuous or so
well adapted to serve in the action.<a id="FNanchor_218" href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> Posts may have supported the
gallery, but I find it difficult to visualize the back of the stage
without supposing these to have been veiled by the hangings. But two
of them may have become visible when the hangings were drawn, or some
porch-like projection from the back wall may have had its posts, and
one of these may be in question, at any rate in the indoor scenes.</p>

<p>The roof of the heavens was presumably used to facilitate certain
spectacular effects, the tradition of which the public theatres
inherited from the miracle-plays and the Court stage.<a id="FNanchor_219" href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> Startling
atmospheric phenomena were not infrequently represented.<a id="FNanchor_220" href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> These
came most naturally in out-of-door scenes, but I have noted one example
in a scene which on general grounds one would classify as a hall
scene.<a id="FNanchor_221" href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span> illusion may not have gone much beyond a painted cloth
drawn under the roof of the heavens.<a id="FNanchor_222" href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> More elaborate machinery may
have been entailed by aerial ascents and descents, which were also
not uncommon. Many Elizabethan actors were half acrobats, and could
no doubt fly upon a wire; but there is also clear evidence for the
use of a chair let down from above.<a id="FNanchor_223" href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> And was the arrangement of
cords and pulleys required for this purpose also that by which the
chair of state, which figures in so many hall scenes and even a few
out-of-door scenes, was put into position?<a id="FNanchor_224" href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> Henslowe had a throne
made in the heavens of the Rose in 1595.<a id="FNanchor_225" href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> Jonson sneered at the
jubilation of boyhood over the descent of the creaking chair.<a id="FNanchor_226" href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> The
device would lighten the labours of the tire-man, for a state would be
an awkward thing to carry on and off. It would avoid the presence of
a large incongruous property on the stage during action to which it
was inappropriate. And it would often serve as a convenient<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span> signal
for the beginning or ending of a hall scene. But to this aspect of the
matter I must return.<a id="FNanchor_227" href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> Whatever the machinery, it must have been
worked in some way from the upper part of the tire-house; possibly from
the somewhat obscure third floor, which De Witt’s drawing leaves to
conjecture; possibly from the superstructure known as the hut, if that
really stood further forward than De Witt’s drawing suggests. Perhaps
the late reference to Jove leaning on his elbows in the garret, or
employed to make squibs and crackers to grace the play, rather points
to the former hypothesis.<a id="FNanchor_228" href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a> In favour of the latter, for what it
is worth, is the description, also late, of a theatre set up by the
English actors under John Spencer at Regensburg in 1613. This had a
lower stage for music, over that a main stage thirty feet high with a
roof supported by six great pillars, and under the roof a quadrangular
aperture, through which beautiful effects were contrived.<a id="FNanchor_229" href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a></p>

<p>There has been a general abandonment of the hypothesis, which found
favour when De Witt’s drawing was first discovered, of a division of
the stage into an inner and an outer part by a ‘traverse’ curtain
running between the two posts, perhaps supplemented by two other
curtains running from the posts back to the tire-house.<a id="FNanchor_230" href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> Certainly
I do not wish to revive it. Any such arrangement would be inconsistent
with the use of the tire-house doors and gallery in out-of-door scenes;
for, on the hypothesis, these were played with the traverse closed.
And it would entail a serious interference with the vision of such
scenes by spectators sitting far round in the galleries or ‘above the
stage’. It does not, of course, follow that no use at all was made
of curtains upon the stage. It is true that no hangings of any kind
are shown by De Witt. Either there were none visible when he drew the
Swan in 1596, or, if they were visible, he failed to draw them; it is
impossible to say which. We know that even the Swan was not altogether
undraped in 1602, for during the riot which followed the ‘cousening
prancke’ of <i>England’s Joy</i> in that year the audience are said
to have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span> ‘revenged themselves upon the hangings, curtains, chairs,
stooles, walles, and whatsoever came in their way’.<a id="FNanchor_231" href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> It is not,
indeed, stated that these hangings and curtains were upon the stage,
and possibly, although not very probably, they may have been in the
auditorium. Apart, however, from the Swan, there is abundant evidence
for the use of some kind of stage hangings in the public theatres of
the sixteenth century generally. To the references in dialogue and
stage-directions quoted in the footnotes to this chapter may be added
the testimony of Florio in 1598, of Ben Jonson in 1601, of Heywood in
1608, and of Flecknoe after the Restoration.<a id="FNanchor_232" href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> We can go further,
and point to several passages which attest a well-defined practice,
clearly going back to the sixteenth century, of using black hangings
for the special purpose of providing an appropriate setting for a
tragedy.<a id="FNanchor_233" href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> Where then were these hangings? For a front<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span> curtain,
on the public stage, as distinct from the Court stage, there is no
evidence whatever, and the precautions taken to remove dead bodies
in the course of action enable us quite safely to leave it out of
account.<a id="FNanchor_234" href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> There may have been hangings of a decorative kind in
various places, of course; round the base of the stage, for example,
or dependent, as Malone thought, from the heavens. But the only place
where we can be sure that there were hangings was what Heywood calls
the ‘fore-front’ of the stage, by which it seems clear from Florio that
he means the fore-front of the tiring-house, which was at the same time
the back wall of the stage. It is, I believe, exclusively to hangings
in this region that our stage-directions refer. Their terminology is
not quite uniform. ‘Traverse’ I do not find in a sixteenth-century
public play.<a id="FNanchor_235" href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> By far the most common term is ‘curtain’, but I do
not think that there is any technical difference between ‘curtain’
and the not infrequent ‘arras’ or the unique ‘veil’ of <i>The Death
of Robin Hood</i>.<a id="FNanchor_236" href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> ‘Arras’ is the ordinary Elizabethan name for
a hanging<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span> of tapestry used as a wall decoration, and often projected
from a frame so as to leave a narrow space, valuable to eavesdroppers
and other persons in need of seclusion, between itself and the wall.
The stage arras serves precisely this purpose as a background to
interior scenes. Here stand the murderers in <i>King John</i>; here
Falstaff goes to sleep in <i>1 Henry IV</i>; and here too he proposes
to ‘ensconce’ himself, in order to avoid being confronted with both his
ladyloves together in <i>The Merry Wives</i>.<a id="FNanchor_237" href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a></p>

<p>The stage-directions, however, make it quite clear that the curtains
were not merely an immovable decoration of the back wall. They could
be ‘opened’ and ‘shut’ or ‘closed’; and either operation could
indifferently be expressed by the term ‘drawn’. This drawing was
presumably effected by sliding the curtain laterally along a straight
rod to which it was affixed by rings sewn on to its upper edge; there
is no sign of any rise or fall of the curtain. The operator may be
an actor upon the stage; in <i>Bacon and Bungay</i> Friar Bacon
draws the curtains ‘with a white sticke’. He may be the speaker of
a prologue.<a id="FNanchor_238" href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a> Whether the ‘servitours’ of a theatre ever came
upon the stage, undisguised, to draw the curtains, I am uncertain;
but obviously it would be quite easy to work the transformation from
behind, by a cord and pulley, without any visible intervention.<a id="FNanchor_239" href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a>
The object of the drawing is to introduce interior action, either in
a mere recess, or in a larger space, such as a chamber; and this, not
only where curtains are dramatically appropriate, as within a house,
or at the door of a tent, but also where they are less so, as before a
cave or a forest bower. One may further accept the term ‘discovered’
as indicating the unveiling of an interior by the play of a curtain,
even when the curtain is not specifically mentioned;<a id="FNanchor_240" href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> and may
recognize that the stage-directions sometimes use ‘Enter’ and ‘Exit’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
in a loose sense of persons, who do not actually move in or out, but
are ‘discovered’, or covered, by a curtain.<a id="FNanchor_241" href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a></p>

<p>Of what nature, then, was the space so disclosed? There was ordinarily,
as already stated, a narrow space behind an arras; and if the gallery
above the stage jutted forward, or had, as the Swan drawing perhaps
indicates, a projecting weather-board, this might be widened into a
six- or seven-foot corridor, still in front of the back wall.<a id="FNanchor_242" href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a>
Such a corridor would, however, hardly give the effect of a chamber,
although it might that of a portico. Nor would it be adequate in
size to hold all the scenes which it is natural to class as chamber
scenes; such, for example, as that in <i>Tamburlaine</i>, where no
less than ten persons are discovered grouped around Zenocrate’s
bed.<a id="FNanchor_243" href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> The stage-directions themselves do not help us much; that
in <i>Alphonsus</i> alone names ‘the place behind the stage’, and as
this is only required to contain the head of Mahomet, a corridor, in
this particular scene, would have sufficed.<a id="FNanchor_244" href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a> There is, however,
no reason why the opening curtains should not have revealed a quite
considerable aperture in the back wall, and an alcove or recess of
quite considerable size lying behind this aperture. With a 43-foot
stage, as at the Fortune, and doors placed rather nearer the ends of
it than De Witt shows them, it would be possible to get a 15-foot
aperture, and still leave room for the drawn curtains to hang between
the aperture and the doors. Allow 3 feet for the strip of stage between
arras and wall, and a back-run of 10 feet behind the wall, and you
get an adequate chamber of 15 feet × 13 feet. My actual measurements
are, of course, merely illustrative. There would be advantages, as
regards vision, in not making the alcove too deep. The height, if
the gallery over the stage ran in a line with the middle gallery for
spectators, would be about 8 feet or 9 feet; rather low, I admit.<a id="FNanchor_245" href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a>
A critic may point out that behind the back wall of the outer stage
lay the tire-house, and that the 14-foot deep framework of a theatre
no greater in dimensions than the Fortune does not leave room for an
inner stage in addition to the tire-house. I think the answer is that
the ‘place behind the stage’ was in fact nothing but an <i>enclave</i>
within the tire-house, that its walls consisted of nothing but screens
covered with some more arras, that these were only put up when they
were needed for some particular scene, and that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span> when they were up,
although they extended to nearly the full depth of the tire-house, they
did not occupy its full width, but left room on either side for the
actors to crowd into, and for the stairs leading to the upper floors.
When no interior scene had to be set, there was nothing between the
tire-house and the outer stage but the curtains; and this renders quite
intelligible the references quoted in an earlier chapter to actors
peeping through a curtain at the audience, and to the audience ‘banding
tile and pear’ against the curtains, to allure the actors forth.<a id="FNanchor_246" href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a> I
do not think it is necessary to assume that there was a third pair of
folding doors permanently fixed in the aperture.<a id="FNanchor_247" href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> They would be big
and clumsy, although no doubt they would help to keep out noise. In any
case, there is not much evidence on the point. If Tarlton’s head was
seen ‘the Tire-House doore and tapistrie betweene’, he may very well
have gone to the end of the narrow passage behind the arras, and looked
out where that was broken by one of the side-doors. No doubt, however,
the aperture is the third place of entrance ‘in the midst’, which the
stage-directions or action of some plays require, and which, as such,
came to be regarded as a third door.<a id="FNanchor_248" href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a></p>

<p>I conceive, therefore, of the alcove as a space which the tire-man,
behind the curtains and in close proximity to the screens and
properties stored in the tire-house, can arrange as he likes, without
any interruption to continuous action proceeding on the outer stage. He
can put up a house-front with a door, and if needed, a porch. He can
put up a shop, or for that matter, a couple of adjacent shops. He can
put up the arched gates of a city or castle. These are comparatively
shallow structures. But he can also take advantage of the whole depth
of the space, and arrange a chamber, a cave, or a bower, furnishing it
as he pleases, and adding doors at the back or side, or a back window,
which would enable him to give more light, even if only borrowed light
from the tire-house, to an interior scene.<a id="FNanchor_249" href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> One point, however,
is rather puzzling. There are some scenes which imply entrance to a
chamber, not from behind, but from the open stage in front, and by
a visible door which can be knocked at or locked. Thus in <i>Romeo
and Juliet</i>, of which all the staging is rather difficult on any
hypothesis, the Friar observes Juliet coming towards his cell, and
after they have discoursed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span> Juliet bids him shut the door. Here, no
doubt, the Friar may have looked out and seen Juliet through a back
window, and she may have entered by a back door. But in an earlier
scene, where we get the stage-direction ‘Enter Nurse and knockes’, and
the knocking is repeated until the Nurse is admitted to the cell, we
are, I think, bound to suppose that the entry is in front, in the sight
of the audience, and antecedent to the knocking.<a id="FNanchor_250" href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> Perhaps an even
clearer case is in <i>Captain Thomas Stukeley</i>, where Stukeley’s
chamber in the Temple is certainly approached from the open stage by
a door at which Stukeley’s father knocks, and which is unlocked and
locked again.<a id="FNanchor_251" href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> Yet how can a door be inserted in that side of a
chamber which is open to the stage and the audience. Possibly it was a
very conventional door set across the narrow space between the arras
and the back wall<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span> of the main stage, at the corner of the aperture and
at right angles to its plane. The accompanying diagrams will perhaps
make my notion of the inner stage clearer.</p>

  </div>

<p>It has been suggested, by me as well as by others, that the inner stage
may have been raised by a step or two above the outer stage.<a id="FNanchor_252" href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> On
reflection, I now think this unlikely. There would be none too much
height to spare, at any rate if the height of the alcove was determined
by that of the spectators’ galleries. The only stage-direction which
suggests any such arrangement is in the <i>Death of Robin Hood</i>,
where the King sits in a chair behind the curtains, and the Queen
ascends to him and descends again.<a id="FNanchor_253" href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> But even if the tire-man put
up an exalted seat in this case, there need have been no permanent
elevation. The missing woodcut of the Anglo-German stage at Frankfort
in 1597 is said to have shown a raised inner stage;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span> but until it is
recovered, it is difficult to estimate its value as testimony upon the
structure of the London theatres.<a id="FNanchor_254" href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a></p>

<p>It must not, of course, be taken for granted that every curtain,
referred to in text or stage-directions as ‘drawn’, was necessarily a
back curtain disclosing an alcove. In some, although not all, of the
bedchamber scenes the indications do not of themselves exclude the
hypothesis of a bed standing on the open stage and the revealing of the
occupant by the mere drawing of bed-curtains.<a id="FNanchor_255" href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> I do not think there
is any certain example of such an arrangement in a sixteenth-century
play.<a id="FNanchor_256" href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> But tents also could be closed by curtains, and the plot of
<i>2 Seven Deadly Sins</i> requires Henry VI to lie asleep in ‘A tent
being plast one the stage’, while dumb-shows enter ‘at one dore’ and
‘at an other dore’.<a id="FNanchor_257" href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a> However it may have been with other theatres,
we cannot, on the evidence before us, assert that the Swan had an
alcove at all; and if it had not, it was probably driven to provide for
chamber scenes by means of some curtained structure on the stage itself.</p>

<p>On the other hand, it must not be supposed that every case, in which
a back curtain was drawn, will have found record in the printed book
of the play concerned; and when the existence of an alcove has once
been established, it becomes legitimate to infer its use for various
chamber and analogous scenes, to the presentation of which it would
have been well adapted. But this inference, again, must not be twisted
into a theory that the stage in front of the back wall served only for
out-of-door scenes, and that all interior action was housed, wholly
or in part, in the alcove. This is, I think, demonstrably untrue, as
regards the large group of indoor scenes which I have called hall
scenes. In the first place, the alcove would not have been spacious
enough to be of any value for a great many of the hall scenes. You
could not stage spectacular action, such as that of a coronation, a
sitting of parliament, or a trial at the bar, in a box of 15 by 13 feet
and only 9 feet high. A group of even so many as ten persons clustered
round a bed is quite another thing. I admit the device of the so-called
‘split’ scene, by which action<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span> beginning in the alcove is gradually
extended so as to take the whole of the stage into its ambit.<a id="FNanchor_258" href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a>
This might perhaps serve for a court of justice, with the judges in
the alcove, the ‘bar’ drawn across the aperture, and the prisoners
brought in before it. A scene in which the arras is drawn in <i>Sir
Thomas More</i> points to such a setting.<a id="FNanchor_259" href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a> But a scene in which a
royal ‘state’ is the dominating feature would be singularly ineffective
if the state were wedged in under the low roof of the alcove; and if
I am right in thinking that the ‘state’ normally creaked down into
its position from the heavens, it would clearly land, not within the
alcove, but upon the open stage in front of it. Indeed, if it could
be placed into position behind a curtain, there would be no reason
for bringing it from the heavens at all. Then, again, hall scenes
are regularly served by two or more doors, which one certainly would
not suppose from the stage-directions to be any other than the doors
similarly used to approach out-of-door scenes; and they frequently
end with injunctions to ‘come in’, which would be superfluous if the
personages on the stage could be withdrawn from sight by the closing
of the curtain. Occasionally, moreover, the gallery over the stage
comes into play in a hall scene, in a way which would not be possible
if the personages were disposed in the alcove, over which, of course,
this gallery projected.<a id="FNanchor_260" href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a> Some of these considerations tell more
directly against the exclusive use of the alcove for hall scenes, than
against its use in combination with the outer stage; and this combined
use, where suitable, I am quite prepared to allow. But ordinarily, I
think, the hall scenes were wholly on the outer stage; and this must
necessarily have been the case where two rooms were employed, of which
one opens out behind the other.<a id="FNanchor_261" href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a></p>

<p>It may be said that the main object of the curtain is to allow of
the furniture and decorations of a ‘set’ scene, which is usually an
interior scene, being put in place behind it, without any interruption
to the continuous progress of an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span> act; and that hall scenes cannot
be set properly, unless they also are behind the curtain line. I do
not think that there is much in this argument. A hall scene does
not require so much setting as a chamber scene. It is sufficiently
furnished, at any rate over the greater part of its area, with the
state and such lesser seats as can very readily be carried on during
the opening speeches or during the procession by which the action is
often introduced. A bar can be set up, or a banquet spread, or a sick
man brought in on his chair, as part of the action itself.<a id="FNanchor_262" href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a> Even
an out-of-door scene, such as an execution or a duel in the lists,
sometimes demands a similar adjustment;<a id="FNanchor_263" href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a> it need no more give pause
than the analogous devices entailed by the removal of dead bodies from
where they have fallen.</p>

<p>I must not be taken to give any countenance to the doctrine that
properties, incongruous to the particular scene that was being played,
were allowed to stand on the public Elizabethan stage, and that the
audience, actually or through a convention, was not disturbed by
them.<a id="FNanchor_264" href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a> This doctrine appears to me to rest upon misunderstandings
of the evidence produced in its support, and in particular upon a
failure to distinguish between the transitional methods of setting
employed by Lyly and his clan, and those of the permanent theatres
with which we are now concerned. The former certainly permitted of
incongruities in the sense that, as the neo-classic stage strove to
adapt itself to a romantic subject-matter, separate localities, with
inconsistent properties, came to be set at one and the same time in
different regions of the stage. But the system proved inadequate to
the needs of romanticism, as popular audiences understood it; and,
apart from some apparent rejuvenescence in the ‘private’ houses,
with which I must deal later, it gave way, about the time of the
building of the permanent theatres, to the alternative system, by
which different localities were represented, not synchronously but
successively, and each in its turn had full occupation of the whole
field of the stage. This full occupation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span> was not, I venture to think,
qualified by the presence in any scene of a property inappropriate
to that scene, but retained there because it had been used for some
previous, or was to be used for some coming, scene. I do not mean to
say that some colourless or insignificant property, such as a bench,
may not have served, without being moved, first in an indoors and then
in an out-of-doors scene. But that the management of the Theatre or
the Rose was so bankrupt in ingenuity that the audience had to watch
a coronation through a fringe of trees or to pretend unconsciousness
while the strayed lovers in a forest dodged each other round the
corners of a derelict ‘state’, I, for one, see no adequate reason to
believe. It is chiefly the state and the trees which have caused the
trouble. But, after all, a state which has creaked down can creak up
again, just as a banquet or a gallows which has been carried on can be
carried off. Trees are perhaps a little more difficult. A procession
of porters, each with a tree in his arms, would be a legitimate
subject for the raillery of <i>The Admirable Bashville</i>. A special
back curtain painted <i>en pastoralle</i> would hardly be adequate,
even if there were any evidence for changes of curtain; trees were
certainly sometimes practicable and therefore quasi-solid.<a id="FNanchor_265" href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> The
alcove, filled with shrubs, would by itself give the illusion of a
greenhouse rather than a forest; moreover, the alcove was available in
forest scenes to serve as a rustic bower or cottage.<a id="FNanchor_266" href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a> Probably the
number of trees dispersed over the body of the stage was not great;
they were a symbolical rather than a realistic setting. On the whole,
I am inclined to think that, at need, trees ascended and descended
through traps; and that this is not a mere conjecture is suggested by
a few cases in which the ascent and descent, being part of a conjuring
action, are recorded in the stage-directions.<a id="FNanchor_267" href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a> One of these shows
that the traps would carry not merely a tree but an arbour. The traps
had, of course, other functions. Through them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span> apparitions arose and
sank;<a id="FNanchor_268" href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a> Jonah was spewed up from the whale’s belly;<a id="FNanchor_269" href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a> and the
old device of hell-mouth still kept alive a mediaeval tradition.<a id="FNanchor_270" href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a>
Only primitive hydraulics would have been required to make a fountain
flow or a fog arise;<a id="FNanchor_271" href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a> although it may perhaps be supposed that
the episodes, in which personages pass to and from boats or fling
themselves into a river, were performed upon the extreme edge of the
stage rather than over a trap.<a id="FNanchor_272" href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a> I do not find any clear case, in
the public sixteenth-century theatres, of the convention apparently
traceable in Lyly and Whetstone, by which the extreme edge of the
stage is used for ‘approach’ scenes, as when a traveller arrives from
afar, or when some episode has to be represented in the environs of a
city which furnishes the principal setting.<a id="FNanchor_273" href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a> And I think it would
certainly be wrong to regard the main stage, apart from the alcove,
as divided into an inner area covered by the heavens and an outer
area, not so covered and appropriate to open-country scenes. Indeed,
the notion that any substantial section of the stage appeared to the
audience not to lie under the heavens is in my view an illusion due
to the unskilful draughtsmanship of De Witt or his copyist. Skyey
phenomena belong most naturally to open-country scenes, nor are these
wholly debarred from the use of the state; and the machinery employed
in both cases seems to imply the existence of a superincumbent
heavens.<a id="FNanchor_274" href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a></p>

<p>I come finally to the interesting question of the gallery above the
stage. This, in the Swan drawing, may project very slightly over the
scenic wall, and is divided by short vertical columns into six small
compartments, in each of which one or two occupants are sitting. They
might, of course, be personages in the play; but, if so, they seem
curiously dissociated from the action. They might be musicians, but
they appear to include women, and there is no clear sign of musical
instruments. On the whole, they have the air of spectators.<a id="FNanchor_275" href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a>
However this may be, let us recall<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span> what has already been established
in an earlier chapter, that there is conclusive evidence for some use
of the space above the stage for spectators, at least until the end
of the sixteenth century, and for some use of it as a music-room, at
least during the seventeenth century.<a id="FNanchor_276" href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a> With these uses we have to
reconcile the equally clear indications that this region, or some part
of it, was available when needed, throughout the whole of the period
under our consideration, as a field for dramatic action. For the moment
we are only concerned with the sixteenth century. A glance back over my
footnotes will show many examples in which action is said to be ‘above’
or ‘aloft’, or is accompanied by the ascent or descent of personages
from or to the level of the main stage. This interplay of different
levels is indeed the outstanding characteristic of the Elizabethan
public theatre, as compared with the other systems of stage-presentment
to which it stands in relation. There are mediaeval analogies, no
doubt, and one would not wish to assert categorically that no use was
ever made of a balcony or a house-roof in a Greek or Roman or Italian
setting. But, broadly speaking, the classical and neo-classical
stage-tradition, apart from theophanies, is one of action on a single
level. Even in the Elizabethan Court drama, the platform comes in
late and rarely, although the constant references to ‘battlements’
in the Revels Accounts enable us to infer that, by the time when the
public theatres came to be built, the case of <i>Orestes</i> was not
an isolated one. Battlements, whatever the extension which the Revels
officers came to give to the term, were primarily for the beloved
siege scenes, and to the way in which siege scenes were treated in the
theatres I must revert. But from two plays, <i>The Rare Triumphs of
Love and Fortune</i> and <i>The Woman in the Moon</i>, both of which
probably represent a late development of the Court drama, we may gather
at least one other definite function of the platform, as a point of
vantage from which presenters, in both cases of a divine type, may
sit ‘sunning like a crow in a gutter’, and watch the evolution of
their puppets on the stage below.<a id="FNanchor_277" href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a> This disposition of presenters
‘aloft’ finds more than one parallel in the public theatres. The divine
element is retained in <i>The Battle of Alcazar</i>, where Henslowe’s
plot gives us, as part of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span> direction for a dumb-show, ‘Enter aboue
Nemesis’.<a id="FNanchor_278" href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a> There are traces of it also in <i>James IV</i> and in
<i>A Looking Glass for London and England</i>. In <i>James IV</i> the
presenters are Bohan, a Scot, and Oberon, king of fairies. They come
on the stage for an induction, at the end of which Bohan says, ‘Gang
with me to the Gallery, and Ile show thee the same in action by guid
fellowes of our country men’, and they ‘<i>Exeunt</i>’. Obviously they
watch the action, for they enter again and comment upon it during act-intervals.
One of their interpositions is closed with the words ‘Gow
shrowd vs in our harbor’; another with ‘Lets to our sell, and sit
&amp; see the rest’.<a id="FNanchor_279" href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a> In the <i>Looking Glass</i> we get after the
first scene the direction, ‘Enters brought in by an angell Oseas the
Prophet, and set downe ouer the Stage in a Throne’. Oseas is evidently
a presenter; the actors ignore him, but he makes moral comments after
various scenes, and at the end of Act <span class="allsmcap">IV</span> comes the further
direction, ‘Oseas taken away’.<a id="FNanchor_280" href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a> Purely human presenters in <i>The
Taming of a Shrew</i> are still on a raised level. Sly is removed from
the main stage during the first scene of the induction. He is brought
back at the beginning of the second scene, presumably above, whence he
criticizes the play, for towards the end the lord bids his servants</p>

<p class="p-left">and this is done by way of an epilogue.<a id="FNanchor_281" href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a></p>

<p>I do not suggest that presenters were always above; it is not so when
they merely furnish the equivalent of a prologue or epilogue, but only
when it is desired to keep them visible during the action, and on
the other hand they must not obstruct it. Sometimes, even when their
continued presence might be desirable, it has to be dispensed with, or
otherwise provided for. The presenters in <i>Soliman and Perseda</i>
come and go; those in <i>The Spanish Tragedy</i> sit upon the stage
itself. Why? I think the answer is the same in both cases. A platform
was required for other purposes. In <i>Soliman and Perseda</i> one
scene has the outer wall of a tiltyard reached by ladders from the
stage; another has a tower, from which victims are tumbled down out
of sight.<a id="FNanchor_282" href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a> In the <i>Spanish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span> Tragedy</i>, apart from some minor
action ‘above’, there is the elaborate presentation of Hieronimo’s
‘play within the play’ to be provided for. This must be supposed to
be part of a hall scene. It occupies, with its preparations, most of
the fourth, which is the last, act; and for it the King and his train
are clearly seated in an upper ‘gallerie’, while the performance
takes place on the floor of the hall below, with the body of Horatio
concealed behind a curtain, for revelation at the appropriate
moment.<a id="FNanchor_283" href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a> We are thus brought face to face with an extension on
the public stage of the use of ‘above’, beyond what is entailed by
the needs of sieges or of exalted presenters. Nor, of course, are the
instances already cited exhaustive. The gallery overlooking a hall in
the <i>Spanish Tragedy</i> has its parallel in the window overlooking
a hall in <i>Dr. Faustus</i>.<a id="FNanchor_284" href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a> More frequent is an external
window, door, or balcony, overlooking an external scene in street or
garden.<a id="FNanchor_285" href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a> In these cases the action ‘above’ is generally slight.
Some one appears in answer to a summons from without; an eavesdropper
listens to a conversation below; a girl talks to her lover, and there
may be an ascent or descent with the help of a rope-ladder or a basket.
But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span> there are a few plays in which we are obliged to constitute the
existence of a regular chamber scene, with several personages and
perhaps furniture, set ‘above’. The second scene of the induction to
the <i>Taming of the Shrew</i>, just cited, is already a case in point.
The presenters here do not merely sit, as spectators in the lord’s room
might, and listen. They move about a chamber and occupy considerable
space. Scenes which similarly require the whole interior of an upper
room to be visible, and not merely its balcony or window bay, are
to be found in <i>1 Sir John Oldcastle</i>, in <i>Every Man In his
Humour</i>, twice in <i>The Jew of Malta</i>, in <i>2 Henry IV</i>, and
in <i>Look About You</i>.<a id="FNanchor_286" href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a> I do not know whether I ought to add
<i>Romeo and Juliet</i>. Certainly the love scenes, Act <span class="allsmcap">II</span>,
scc. i and ii, and Act <span class="allsmcap">III</span>, sc. v, require Juliet’s chamber to
be aloft, and in these there is no interior action entailing more than
the sound of voices, followed by the appearance of the speakers over
Juliet’s shoulder as she stands at the casement or on a balcony.<a id="FNanchor_287" href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a>
It would be natural to assume that the chamber of Act <span class="allsmcap">IV</span>,
sc. iii, in which Juliet drinks her potion, and sc. v, in which she
is found lying on her bed, is the same, and therefore also aloft.
Obviously its interior, with the bed and Juliet, must be visible to the
spectators. The difficulty is that it also appears to be visible to
the wedding guests and the musicians, as they enter the courtyard from
without; and this could only be, if it were upon the main<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span> level of
the stage. If the scene stood by itself, one would undoubtedly assign
it to the curtained recess behind the stage; and on the whole it is
probable that on this occasion architectural consistency was sacrificed
to dramatic effect, and Juliet’s chamber was placed sometimes above and
sometimes below.<a id="FNanchor_288" href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a> There is one other type of scene which requires
elevated action, and that is the senate-house scene, as we find it in
<i>The Wounds of Civil War</i> and in <i>Titus Andronicus</i>, where
the Capitol clearly stands above the Forum, but is within ear-shot and
of easy approach.<a id="FNanchor_289" href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a></p>

<p>I think we are bound to assume that some or all of this action ‘above’
took place in the gallery ‘over the stage’, where it could be readily
approached from the tiring-house behind, and could be disposed with the
minimum of obstruction to the vision of the auditorium. A transition
from the use of this region for spectators to its use for action is
afforded by the placing there of those idealized spectators, the
presenters. So far as they are concerned, all that would be needed, in
a house arranged like the Swan, would be to assign to them one or more,
according to their number, of the rooms or compartments, into which the
gallery was normally divided. One such compartment, too, would serve
well for a window, and would be accepted without demur as forming part
of the same ‘domus’ to which a door below, or, as in <i>The Merchant
of Venice</i>, a penthouse set in the central aperture, gave access.
To get a practicable chamber, it would be necessary to take down a
partition and throw two of the compartments, probably the two central
compartments, into one; but there would still be four rooms left for
the lords. As a matter of fact, most upper chamber scenes, even of
the sixteenth century, are of later date than the Swan drawing, and
some architectural evolution, including the provision of a music-room,
may already have taken place, and have been facilitated by the waning
popularity of the lord’s rooms. It will be easier to survey the whole
evolution of the upper stage in the next chapter.<a id="FNanchor_290" href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a> For the present,
let us think of the upper chamber as running back on the first floor of
the tiring-house above the alcove, and reached from within by stairs
behind the scenic wall, of which, if desired, the foot could perhaps be
made visible within the alcove.<a id="FNanchor_291" href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a> Borrowed light could be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span> given by
a window at the back, from which also the occupants of the room could
pretend to look out behind.<a id="FNanchor_292" href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a> Internal doors could of course also
be made available. A scene in <i>The Jew of Malta</i> requires a trap
in the floor of the upper chamber, over a cauldron discovered in the
alcove below.<a id="FNanchor_293" href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a> The upper chamber could be fitted, like the alcove
itself, with an independent curtain for discoveries.<a id="FNanchor_294" href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a></p>

<p>Are we to conclude that all action ‘above’ was on or behind the back
line of the stage? The point upon which I feel most uncertainty is
the arrangement of the battlements in the stricter sense.<a id="FNanchor_295" href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a> These
appear to be generally regarded as running along the whole of the back
line, with the gates of the town or castle represented in the central
aperture below. Some writers suggest that they occupied, not the actual
space of the rooms or boxes ‘over the stage’, but a narrow balcony
running in front of these.<a id="FNanchor_296" href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a> I cannot satisfy myself that the Swan
drawing bears out the existence of any projecting ledge adequate for
the purpose. On the other hand, if all the compartments of the gallery
were made available and their partitions removed, all the spectators
‘over the stage’ must have been displaced; and siege scenes are early,
and numerous. I do not know that it is essential to assume that the
battlements extended beyond the width of two compartments. There is
some definite evidence for a position of the ‘walles’ on the scenic
line, apart from the patent convenience of keeping the main stage clear
for besieging armies, in Jasper Mayne’s laudation of Ben Jonson:</p>

  <div class="poetry-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div>Thou laid’st no sieges to the music-room.<a id="FNanchor_297" href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a></div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

<p class="p-left">I am content to believe that this is where they normally
stood. At the same time, it is possible that alternative arrangements
were not unknown. In the <i>Wagner Book</i>, which must be supposed to
describe a setting of a type not incredible on the public stage, we are
told of a high throne,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span> presumably at the back, of hell mouth ‘at the
one end of the stage’, and of an elaborate castle ‘at the other end in
opposition’. This is ‘the place where in the bloudlesse skirmishes are
so often perfourmed upon the stage’, and although I should not press
this as meaning that the walls were always at an ‘end’ of the stage,
the passage would be absurd, if they were invariably at the back.<a id="FNanchor_298" href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a>
Further, there is at least one extant play in which it is very
difficult to envisage certain scenes with the walls at the back. This
is <i>1 Henry VI</i>, the Orleans scenes of which, with the leaping
over the walls, and the rapid succession of action in the market-place
within the town and in the field without, seem to me clearly to point
to walls standing across the main stage from back to front.<a id="FNanchor_299" href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a> But if
so, how were such walls put into place? The imagination boggles at the
notion of masons coming in to build a wall during the action, in the
way in which attendants might set up a bar or a lists, or carpenters
the gibbet for an execution. Bottom’s device for <i>Pyramus and
Thisbe</i> would hardly be more grotesque. Yet the Orleans siege scenes
in <i>1 Henry VI</i> are by no means coincident with acts, and could
not therefore be set in advance and dismantled at leisure when done
with. Can the walls have been drawn forwards and backwards, with the
help of some machine, through the doors or the central aperture?<a id="FNanchor_300" href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a>
It is not inconceivable, and possibly we have here the explanation
of the ‘j whell and frame in the Sege of London’, which figures in
the Admiral’s inventories. Once the possibility of a scenic structure
brought on to the main stage is mooted, one begins to look for other
kinds of episode in which it would be useful. This, after all, may
have been the way in which a gibbet was introduced, and the Admiral’s
had also ‘j frame for the heading in Black Jone’, although nothing
is said of a wheel.<a id="FNanchor_301" href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a> The senate houses could, I think, have been
located in the gallery, but the beacon in <i>King Leir</i> would not
look plausible there,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span> and the Admiral’s had a beacon, apparently as
a detached property.<a id="FNanchor_302" href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a> I am also inclined to think that a wall may
occasionally have been drawn across the stage to make a close of part
of it for a garden scene. In Act <span class="allsmcap">II</span> of <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>
Romeo pretty clearly comes in with his friends in some public place
of the city, and then leaps a wall into an orchard, where he is lost
to their sight, and finds himself under Juliet’s window. He must have
a wall to leap. I mentioned <i>Pyramus and Thisbe</i> just above with
intent, for what is <i>Pyramus and Thisbe</i> but a burlesque of the
<i>Romeo and Juliet</i> motive, which would have been all the more
amusing, if a somewhat conspicuous and unusual wall had been introduced
into its model? Another case in point may be the ‘close walk’ before
Labervele’s house in <i>A Humorous Day’s Mirth</i>.<a id="FNanchor_303" href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a> I have allowed
myself to stray into the field of conjecture.</p>

<p>One other possible feature of action ‘above’ must not be left out of
account. The use of the gallery may have been supplemented on occasion
by that of some window or balcony in the space above it, which De
Witt’s drawing conceals from our view. Here may have been the ‘top’ on
which La Pucelle appears in the Rouen episode of <i>1 Henry VI</i>,
and the towers or turrets, which are sometimes utilized or referred to
in this and other plays.<a id="FNanchor_304" href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a> It would be difficult to describe the
central boxes of the Swan gallery as a tower.</p>

<p>Before any attempt is made to sum up the result of this long
chapter, one other feature of sixteenth-century staging, which is
often overlooked, requires discussion. In the majority of cases the
background of an out-of-door scene need contain at most a single
<i>domus</i>; and this, it is now clear, can be represented either by
a light structure, such as a tent or arbour, placed temporarily upon
the floor of the stage, or more usually by the <i>scena</i> or back
wall, with its doors, its central aperture, and its upper gallery.
There are, however, certain scenes in which one <i>domus</i> will
not suffice, and two or possibly even three, must be represented.
Thus, as in <i>Richard III</i>, there may be two hostile camps, with
alternating action at tents in each of them.<a id="FNanchor_305" href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a> There may also be
interplay, without change of scene, between different houses in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span> one
town or village. In <i>Arden of Feversham</i>, Arden’s house and the
painter’s are set together;<a id="FNanchor_306" href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a> in <i>The Taming of A Shrew</i>,
the lord’s house and the alehouse for the induction, and Polidor’s
and Alphonso’s during the main play;<a id="FNanchor_307" href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a> in <i>The Blind Beggar of
Alexandria</i>, the houses of Elimine and Samethis;<a id="FNanchor_308" href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a> in <i>1 Sir
John Oldcastle</i>, Cobham’s gate and an inn;<a id="FNanchor_309" href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a> in <i>Stukeley</i>,
Newton’s house and a chamber in the Temple;<a id="FNanchor_310" href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a> in <i>A Knack to Know
an Honest Man</i>, Lelio’s and Bristeo’s for one scene, Lelio’s and a
Senator’s for another, possibly Lelio’s and Servio’s, though of this I
am less sure, for a third.<a id="FNanchor_311" href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a> These are the most indisputable cases;
given the principle, we are at liberty to conjecture its application
in other plays. Generally the houses may be supposed to be contiguous;
it is not so in <i>Stukeley</i>, where Old Stukeley clearly walks some
little distance to the Temple, and here therefore we get an example of
that foreshortening of distance between two parts of a city, with which
we became familiar in the arrangement of Court plays.<a id="FNanchor_312" href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a> It is not
the only example. In <i>George a Greene</i> Jenkin and the Shoemaker
walk from one end to the other of Wakefield.<a id="FNanchor_313" href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a> In <i>Arden of
Feversham</i>, although this is an open-country and not an urban scene,
Arden and Francklin travel some little way to Raynham Down.<a id="FNanchor_314" href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a> In
<i>Dr. Faustus</i>, so far as we can judge from the unsatisfactory text
preserved, any limitation to a particular neighbourhood is abandoned,
and Faustus passes without change of scene from the Emperor’s Court
to his own home in Wittenberg.<a id="FNanchor_315" href="#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a> Somewhat analogous is the curious
device in <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>, where the maskers, after preparing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
in the open, ‘march about the stage’, while the scene changes to the
hall of Capulet, which they then enter.<a id="FNanchor_316" href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a></p>

<p>I think, then, it must be taken that the background of a public stage
could stand at need, not merely for a single <i>domus</i>, but for a
‘city’. Presumably in such cases the central aperture and the gallery
above it were reserved for any house in which interior action was to
proceed, and for the others mere doors in the scenic wall were regarded
as adequate. I do not find any sixteenth-century play which demands
either interior action or action ‘above’ in more than one house.<a id="FNanchor_317" href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a>
But a question arises as to how, for a scene in which the scenic
doors had to represent house doors, provision was made for external
entrances and exits, which certainly cannot be excluded from such
scenes. Possibly the answer is, although I feel very doubtful about
it, that there were never more than two houses, and that therefore one
door always remained available to lead on and off the main stage.<a id="FNanchor_318" href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a>
Possibly also entrances and exits by other avenues than the two scenic
doors, which we infer from the Swan drawing, and the central aperture
which we feel bound to add, are not inconceivable. We have already had
some hint that three may not have been the maximum number of entrances.
If the Elizabethan theatre limited itself to three, it would have
been worse off than any of the early neo-classic theatres based upon
Vitruvius, in which the <i>porta regia</i> and <i>portae minores</i> of
the scenic wall were regularly supplemented by the <i>viae ad forum</i>
in the <i>versurae</i> to right and left of the <i>proscenium</i>.<a id="FNanchor_319" href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a>
No doubt such wings could not be constructed at the Swan, where a space
was left on the level of the ‘yard’ between the spectators’ galleries
and the right and left edges of a narrow stage. But they would be
feasible in theatres with wider stages, and the arrangement, if it
existed, would make the problem of seats on the stage easier.<a id="FNanchor_320" href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a>
It is no more than a conjecture. It has also been suggested that the
heavy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span> columns drawn by De Witt may have prevented him from showing
two entrances round the extreme ends of the scenic wall, such as are
perhaps indicated in some of the Terentian woodcuts of 1493.<a id="FNanchor_321" href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a> Or,
finally, actors might have emerged from the tiring-house into the space
on the level of the yard just referred to, and thence reached the
stage, as from without, by means of a short flight of steps.<a id="FNanchor_322" href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a></p>

<p>Working then from the Swan stage, and only departing in any essential
from De Witt’s drawing by what appears to be, at any rate for theatres
other than the Swan, the inevitable addition of a back curtain, we
find no insuperable difficulty in accounting for the setting of all
the types of scenes recognizable in sixteenth-century plays. The great
majority of them, both out-of-door scenes and hall scenes, were acted
on the open stage, under the heavens, with no more properties and
practicable <i>terrains</i> than could reasonably be carried on by the
actors, lowered from the heavens, raised by traps, or thrust on by
frames and wheels. For more permanent background they had the scenic
doors, the gallery above, the scenic curtain, and whatever the tire-man
might choose to insert in the aperture, backed by an alcove within the
tire-house, which the drawing of the curtain discovered. For entrances
they had at least the scenic doors and aperture. The comparatively few
chamber scenes were set either in the alcove or in a chamber ‘above’,
formed by throwing together two compartments of the gallery. A window
in a still higher story could, if necessary, be brought into play. So,
with all due respect to the obscurities of the evidence, I reconstruct
the facts. It will, I hope, be apparent without any elaborate
demonstration that this system of public staging, as practised by
Burbadge at the Theatre, by Lanman at the Curtain, by Henslowe at the
Rose, and perhaps with some modifications by Langley at the Swan, is
very fairly in line with the earlier sixteenth-century tradition, as
we have studied it in texts in which the Court methods are paramount.
This is only natural, in view of the fact that the same plays continued
to be presented to the public and to the sovereign. There is the same
economy of recessed action, the same conspicuous tendency to dialogue
on a threshold, the same unwillingness to break the flow of an act by
any deliberate pause for resetting. The public theatre gets in some
ways a greater variety of dramatic situation, partly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span> owing to its free
use of the open stage, instead of merely a portico, for hall scenes,
partly owing to its characteristic development of action ‘above’.
This, in spite of the battlements of the Revels accounts, may perhaps
be a contribution of the inn-yard. The main change is, of course, the
substitution for the multiple staging of the Court, with its adjacent
regions for different episodes, of a principle of successive staging,
by which the whole space became in turn available for each distinct
scene. This was an inevitable change, as soon as the Elizabethan love
for history and romance broke down the Renaissance doctrine of the
unity of place; and it will not be forgotten that the beginnings of
it are already clearly discernible in the later Court drama, which
of course overlaps with the popular drama, itself. Incidentally the
actors got elbow-room; some of the Lylyan scenes must have been
very cramped. But they had to put up with a common form setting,
capable only of minor modifications, and no doubt their architectural
decorations and unvarying curtain were less interesting from the point
of view of <i>spectacle</i>, than the diversity of ‘houses’ which
the ingenuity and the resources of the Court architects were in a
position to produce. In any case, however, economy would probably have
forbidden them to enter into rivalry with the Revels Office. Whether
the Elizabethan type of public stage was the invention of Burbadge,
the ‘first builder of theatres’, or had already come into use in the
inn-yards, is perhaps an idle subject for wonder. The only definite
guess at its origin is that of Professor Creizenach, who suggests that
it may have been adapted from the out-of-door stages, set up from time
to time for the dramatic contests held by the Rederijker or Chambers
of Rhetoric in Flanders.<a id="FNanchor_323" href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a> Certainly there are common features in
the division of the field of action into two levels and the use of
curtained apertures both below and above. But the latest examples of
the Flemish festivals were at Ghent in 1539 and at Antwerp in 1561
respectively; and it would be something of a chance if Burbadge or any
other English builder had any detailed knowledge of them.<a id="FNanchor_324" href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a></p>

<span class="subhed">STAGING IN THE THEATRES: SEVENTEENTH CENTURY</span></h3></div>

<p class="center sm">[For <i>Bibliographical Note</i>, <i>vide</i> ch. xviii.]</p>


<p>The turn of the century is also a turning-point in the history of the
public theatres. In 1599 the Chamberlain’s men built the Globe, and in
1600, not to be outdone, the Admiral’s men built upon the same model
the Fortune. These remained the head-quarters of the same companies,
when at the beginning of the reign of James the one became the King’s
and the other the Prince’s men. Worcester’s, afterwards the Queen’s,
men were content for a time with the older houses, first the Rose,
then the Curtain and the Boar’s Head, but by 1605 or 1606 they were
occupying the Red Bull, probably a new building, but one of which we
know very little. Meanwhile the earlier Tudor fashion of plays by boys
had been revived, both at Paul’s, and at the Blackfriars, where a
theatre had been contrived by James Burbadge about 1596 in a chamber of
the ancient priory, for the purposes of a public stage.</p>

<p>We cannot on <i>a priori</i> grounds assume that the structural
arrangements of the sixteenth-century houses were merely carried into
those of the seventeenth century without modification; the experience
of twenty-five years’ working may well have disclosed features
in the original plan of James Burbadge which were not altogether
convenient or which lent themselves to further development. On the
other hand, we have not got to take into account the possibility of
any fundamental change or sharp breach of continuity. The introduction
of a new type of stage, even if it escaped explicit record, would
inevitably have left its mark both upon the dramatic construction of
plays and upon the wording of their stage-directions. No such mark
can be discerned. You cannot tell an early seventeenth-century play
from a late sixteenth-century one on this kind of evidence alone;
the handling and the conventions, the situations and the spectacular
effects, remain broadly the same, and such differences as do gradually
become apparent, concern rather the trend of dramatic interest than
the external methods of <span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>stage-presentation. Moreover, it is evident
that the sixteenth-century plays did not pass wholly into disuse. From
time to time they were revived, and lent themselves, perhaps with some
minor adaptation, to the new boards as well as to the old. In dealing
with early seventeenth-century staging, then, I will assume the general
continuance of the sixteenth-century plan, and will content myself with
giving some further examples of its main features, and with considering
any evidence which may seem to point to specific development in one
or more particular directions. And on the whole it will be convenient
to concentrate now mainly upon the theatres occupied by the King’s
men. For this there are various reasons. One is that the possession of
Shakespeare’s plays gives them a prerogative interest in modern eyes;
another that the repertories of the other companies have hardly reached
us in a form which renders any very safe induction feasible.</p>

<p>Even in the case of the King’s men, the material is not very ample, and
there are complications which make it necessary to proceed by cautious
steps to somewhat tentative conclusions. The Globe was probably opened
in the autumn of 1599. The first play which we can definitely locate
there is <i>Every Man Out of his Humour</i>; but I have decided
with some hesitation to treat <i>Henry V</i> and <i>Much Ado about
Nothing</i>, for the purposes of these chapters, as Globe plays.<a id="FNanchor_325" href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a>
So far as we know, the Globe was the only theatre used by the company
up to the winter of 1609, when they also came into possession of the
Blackfriars. From 1609 to 1613 they used both houses, but probably the
Globe was still the more important of the two, for when it was burnt
in 1613 they found it worth while to rebuild it fairer than before. At
some time, possibly about the end of James’s reign, the Blackfriars
began to come into greater prominence, and gradually displaced the
Globe as the main head-quarters of the London drama. This, however, is
a development which lies outside the scope of these volumes; nor can
I with advantage inquire in detail whether there were any important
structural features in which the new Globe is likely to have differed
from the old Globe. At the most I can only offer a suggestion for the
historian of the Caroline stage to take up in his turn. In the main,
therefore, we have to consider the staging of the Globe from 1599 to
1609, and of the Globe and the Blackfriars from 1609 to 1613. The plays
available fall into four groups.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span> There are nineteen or twenty printed
and probably produced during 1599–1609, of which, however, one or
two were originally written for private theatres.<a id="FNanchor_326" href="#Footnote_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a> There are two
produced and printed during 1609–12, and one preserved in manuscript
from the same period.<a id="FNanchor_327" href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a> There are ten probably produced during
1599–1603, but not printed before 1622 or 1623.<a id="FNanchor_328" href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a> There are perhaps
nine or ten produced during 1609–13, and printed at various dates from
1619 to 1634.<a id="FNanchor_329" href="#Footnote_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a> It will be seen that the first group is of much the
greatest value evidentially, as well as fortunately the longest, but
that it only throws light upon the Globe and not upon the Blackfriars;
that the value of the second and fourth groups is discounted by our not
knowing how far they reflect Globe and how far Blackfriars conditions;
and that the original features of the third and fourth groups may
have been modified in revivals, either at the Blackfriars or at the
later Globe, before they got into print. I shall use them all, but,
I hope, with discrimination.<a id="FNanchor_330" href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a> I shall also use, for illustration
and confirmation, rather than as direct evidence, plays from other
seventeenth-century theatres. The Prince’s men were at the Fortune
during the whole of the period with which we are concerned, and then on
to and after the fire of 1621, and the reconstruction, possibly on new
lines, of 1623. We know that its staging arrangements resembled those
of the Globe, for it was provided in the builder’s contract that this
should be so, and also that the stage should be ‘placed and sett’ in
accordance with ‘a plott thereof drawen’. Alleyn would have saved me
a great deal of trouble if he had put away this little piece of paper
along with so many others. Unfortunately, the Prince’s men kept their
plays very close, and only five or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span> six of our period got into print
before 1623.<a id="FNanchor_331" href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a> From the Queen’s men we have rather more, perhaps
sixteen in all; but we do not always know whether these were given at
the Red Bull or the Curtain. Nor do we know whether any structural
improvements introduced at the Globe and Fortune were adopted at the
Red Bull, although this is <i>a priori</i> not unlikely.<a id="FNanchor_332" href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a> From the
Swan we have only <i>The Chaste Maid of Cheapside</i>, and from the
Hope only <i>Bartholomew Fair</i>.</p>

<p>At the Globe, then, the types of scene presented are much the same as
those with which we have become familiar in the sixteenth century; the
old categories of open-country scenes, battle scenes, garden scenes,
street scenes, threshold scenes, hall scenes, and chamber scenes
will still serve. Their relative importance alters, no doubt, as the
playwrights tend more and more to concern themselves with subjects of
urban life. But there are plenty of battle scenes in certain plays,
much on the traditional lines, with marchings and counter-marchings,
alarums for fighting ‘within’, and occasional ‘excursions’ on the
field of the stage itself.<a id="FNanchor_333" href="#Footnote_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a> Practicable tents still afford a
convenient camp background, and these, I think, continue to be pitched
on the open boards.<a id="FNanchor_334" href="#Footnote_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a> The opposing camps of <i>Richard III</i> are
precisely repeated in <i>Henry V</i>.<a id="FNanchor_335" href="#Footnote_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a> There are episodes before
the ‘walls’ too, with defenders speaking from above, assaults by means
of scaling ladders, and coming and going through the gates.<a id="FNanchor_336" href="#Footnote_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a> I
find no example in which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span> a wall inserted on the line of the scenic
curtain would not meet the needs of the situation. Pastoral scenes are
also common, for the urban preoccupation has its regular reaction in
the direction of pastoral. There is plenty of evidence for practicable
trees, such as that on which Orlando in <i>As You Like It</i> hangs
his love verses, and the most likely machinery for putting trees into
position still seems to me to be the trap.<a id="FNanchor_337" href="#Footnote_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a> A trap, too, might
bring up the bower for the play within the play of <i>Hamlet</i>,
the pleached arbour of <i>Much Ado about Nothing</i>, the pulpit in
the forum of <i>Julius Caesar</i>, the tombstone in the woods of
<i>Timon of Athens</i>, the wayside cross of <i>Every Man Out of
his Humour</i>, and other <i>terrains</i> most easily thought of as
free-standing structures.<a id="FNanchor_338" href="#Footnote_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a> It would open for Ophelia’s grave, and
for the still beloved ascents of spirits from the lower regions.<a id="FNanchor_339" href="#Footnote_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a>
It remains difficult to see how a riverbank or the sea-shores was
represented.<a id="FNanchor_340" href="#Footnote_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a> As a rule, the edge of the stage, with steps into the
auditorium taken for water stairs, seems most plausible. But there is a
complicated episode in <i>The Devil’s Charter</i>, with a conduit and a
bridge over the Tiber, which I do not feel quite able to envisage.<a id="FNanchor_341" href="#Footnote_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a>
There is another bridge over the Tiber for Horatius Cocles in the Red
Bull play of the <i>Rape of Lucrece</i>. But this is easier; it is
projected from the walls of Rome, and there must be a trapped cavity on
the scenic line, into which Horatius leaps.<a id="FNanchor_342" href="#Footnote_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span></p>

<p>The Hope contract of 1613 provides for the heavens to be supported
without the help of posts rising from the stage. For this there was
a special reason at the Hope, since the stage had to be capable of
removal to make room for bear-baitings. But the advantage of dispensing
with the posts and the obstacle to the free vision of the spectators
which they presented must have been so great, that the innovation
may well have occurred to the builders of the Globe. Whether it did,
I do not think that we can say. There are one or two references to
posts in stage-directions, but they need not be the posts of the
heavens.<a id="FNanchor_343" href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a> Possibly, too, there was less use of the descending
chair. One might even fancy that Jonson’s sarcasm in the prologue to
<i>Every Man In his Humour</i> discredited it. The new type of play
did not so often call for spectacular palace scenes, and perhaps
some simpler and more portable kind of ‘state’ was allowed to serve
the turn. There is no suggestion of a descent from the heavens in
the theophanies of <i>As You Like It</i> and <i>Pericles</i>; Juno,
however, descends in <i>The Tempest</i>.<a id="FNanchor_344" href="#Footnote_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a> This, although it has
practically no change of setting, is in some ways, under the mask
influence, the most spectacular performance attempted by the King’s
men at Globe or Blackfriars during our period.<a id="FNanchor_345" href="#Footnote_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a> But it is far
outdone by the Queen’s plays of the <i>Golden</i>, <i>Silver</i>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
and <i>Brazen Ages</i>, which, if they were really given just as
Heywood printed them, must have strained the scenic resources of the
Red Bull to an extreme. Here are ascents and descents and entries
from every conceivable point of the stage;<a id="FNanchor_346" href="#Footnote_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a> divinities in
fantastic disguise;<a id="FNanchor_347" href="#Footnote_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a> mythological dumb-shows;<a id="FNanchor_348" href="#Footnote_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a> battles and
hunting episodes and revels;<a id="FNanchor_349" href="#Footnote_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a> ingenious properties, often with
a melodramatic thrill;<a id="FNanchor_350" href="#Footnote_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a> and from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span> beginning to end a succession
of atmospheric phenomena, which suggest that the Jacobeans had made
considerable progress in the art of stage pyrotechnics.<a id="FNanchor_351" href="#Footnote_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a> The Globe,
with its traditional ‘blazing star’, is left far behind.<a id="FNanchor_352" href="#Footnote_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a></p>

<p>The critical points of staging are the recesses below and above.
Some kind of recess on the level of the main stage is often required
by the King’s plays; for action in or before a prison,<a id="FNanchor_353" href="#Footnote_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a> a
cell,<a id="FNanchor_354" href="#Footnote_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a> a cave,<a id="FNanchor_355" href="#Footnote_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a> a closet,<a id="FNanchor_356" href="#Footnote_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a> a study,<a id="FNanchor_357" href="#Footnote_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a> a tomb,<a id="FNanchor_358" href="#Footnote_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a> a
chapel,<a id="FNanchor_359" href="#Footnote_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a> a shop;<a id="FNanchor_360" href="#Footnote_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a> for the revelation of dead bodies or other
concealed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span> sights.<a id="FNanchor_361" href="#Footnote_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a> In many cases the alcove constructed in the
tiring-house behind the scenic wall would give all that is required,
and occasionally a mention of the ‘curtains’ or of ‘discovery’ in a
stage-direction points plainly to this arrangement. The ‘traverse’ of
Webster’s plays, both for the King’s and the Queen’s men, appears,
as already pointed out, to be nothing more than a terminological
variant.<a id="FNanchor_362" href="#Footnote_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a> Similarly, hall scenes have still their ‘arras’ or their
‘hangings’, behind which a spy can post himself.<a id="FNanchor_363" href="#Footnote_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a> A new feature,
however, now presents itself in the existence of certain scenes,
including some bedchamber scenes, which entail the use of properties
and would, I think, during the sixteenth century have been placed
in the alcove, but now appear to have been brought forward and to
occupy, like hall scenes, the main stage. The usage is by no means
invariable. Even in so late a play as <i>Cymbeline</i>, Imogen’s
chamber, with Iachimo’s trunk and the elaborate fire-places in it,
must, in spite of the absence of any reference to curtains, have been
disposed in the alcove; for the trunk scene is immediately followed
by another before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span> the door of the same chamber, from which Imogen
presently emerges.<a id="FNanchor_364" href="#Footnote_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a> But I do not think that the alcove was used
for Gertrude’s closet in <i>Hamlet</i>, the whole of which play seems
to me to be set very continuously on the outer stage.<a id="FNanchor_365" href="#Footnote_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a> Hamlet does
not enter the closet direct from in front, but goes off and comes on
again. A little distance is required for the vision of the Ghost, who
goes out at a visible ‘portal’. When Hamlet has killed Polonius, he
lugs the guts into the neighbour room, according to the ordinary device
for clearing a dead body from the main stage, which is superfluous when
the death has taken place in the alcove. There is an arras, behind
which Polonius esconces himself, and on this, or perhaps on an inner
arras disclosed by a slight parting of the ordinary one, hangs the
picture of Hamlet’s father. Nor do I think, although it is difficult
to be certain, that the alcove held Desdemona’s death-chamber in
<i>Othello</i>.<a id="FNanchor_366" href="#Footnote_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a> True, there are curtains drawn here, but they may
be only bed-curtains. A longish chamber, with an outer door, seems to
be indicated. A good many persons, including Cassio ‘in a chaire’, have
to be accommodated, and when Emilia enters, it is some time before her
attention is drawn to Desdemona behind the curtains. If anything is in
the alcove, it can only be just the bed itself. The best illustrations
of my point, however, are to be found in <i>The Devil’s Charter</i>,
a singular play, with full and naïve stage-directions, which perhaps
betray the hand of an inexperienced writer. Much of the action takes
place in the palace of Alexander Borgia at Rome. The alcove seems to be
reserved for Alexander’s study. Other scenes of an intimately domestic
character are staged in front, and the necessary furniture is very
frankly carried on, in one case by a protagonist. This is a scene in a
parlour by night, in which Lucrezia Borgia<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span> murders her husband.<a id="FNanchor_367" href="#Footnote_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a>
Another scene represents Lucrezia’s toilet;<a id="FNanchor_368" href="#Footnote_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a> in a third young men
come in from tennis and are groomed by a barber.<a id="FNanchor_369" href="#Footnote_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a> My impression is
that in the seventeenth century, instead of discovering a bedchamber
in the alcove, it became the custom to secure more space and light by
projecting the bed through the central aperture on to the main stage,
and removing it by the same avenue when the scene was over. As to this
a stage-direction in <i>2 Henry VI</i> may be significant. There was a
scene in <i>1 Contention</i> in which the murdered body of the Duke of
Gloucester is discovered in his bedchamber. This recurs in <i>2 Henry
VI</i>, but instead of a full direction for the drawing of curtains,
the Folio has the simple note ‘Bed put forth’.<a id="FNanchor_370" href="#Footnote_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a> This is one of a
group of formulas which have been the subject of some discussion.<a id="FNanchor_371" href="#Footnote_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a>
I do not think that either ‘Bed put forth’ or still less ‘Bed thrust
out’ can be dismissed as a mere equivalent of ‘Enter in a bed’, which
may admittedly cover a parting of the curtains, or of such a warning
to the tire-man as ‘Bed set out’ or ‘ready’ or ‘prepared’.<a id="FNanchor_372" href="#Footnote_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a> There
is a difference between ‘setting out’ and ‘thrusting out’, for the
one does and the other does not carry the notion of a push. And if
‘Bed put forth’ is rather more colourless, ‘Bed drawn out’, which
also occurs, is clear enough. Unfortunately the extant text of <i>2
Henry VI</i> may be of any date up to 1623, and none of the other
examples of the formulas in question are direct evidence for the
Globe in 1599–1613.<a id="FNanchor_373" href="#Footnote_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a> To be sure of the projected bed at so early<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
a date, we have to turn to the Red Bull, where we find it both in
the <i>Golden</i> and the <i>Silver Age</i>, as well as the amateur
<i>Hector of Germany</i>, or to the Swan, where we find it in <i>The
Chaste Maid of Cheapside</i>.<a id="FNanchor_374" href="#Footnote_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a> The <i>Golden Age</i> particularly
repays study. The whole of the last two acts are devoted to the episode
of Jupiter and Danae. The scene is set in</p>

  <div class="poetry-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div class="i5">the Darreine Tower</div>
        <div>Guirt with a triple mure of shining brasse.</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

<p class="p-left">Most of the action requires a courtyard, and the wall
and gate of this, with a porter’s lodge and an alarm-bell, must have
been given some kind of structural representation on the stage. An
inner door is supposed to lead to Danae’s chamber above. It is in this
chamber, presumably, that attendants enter ‘drawing out Danae’s bed’,
and when ‘The bed is drawn in’, action is resumed in the courtyard
below.<a id="FNanchor_375" href="#Footnote_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span></p>

<p>There are chamber scenes in the King’s plays also, which are neither
in the alcove nor on the main stage, but above. This is an extension
of a practice already observable in pre-Globe days. Hero’s chamber
in <i>Much Ado about Nothing</i> is above.<a id="FNanchor_376" href="#Footnote_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a> So is Celia’s in
<i>Volpone</i>.<a id="FNanchor_377" href="#Footnote_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a> So is Falstaff’s at the Garter Inn in <i>The
Merry Wives of Windsor</i>.<a id="FNanchor_378" href="#Footnote_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a> In all these examples, which are not
exhaustive, a reasonable amount of space is required for action.<a id="FNanchor_379" href="#Footnote_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a>
This is still more the case in <i>The Yorkshire Tragedy</i>, where
the violent scene of the triple murder at Calverley Hall is clearly
located upstairs.<a id="FNanchor_380" href="#Footnote_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a> Moreover, there are two plays which stage above
what one would normally regard as hall rather than chamber scenes.
One is <i>Sejanus</i>, where a break in the dialogue in the first act
can best be explained by the interpretation of a scene in an upper
‘gallery’.<a id="FNanchor_381" href="#Footnote_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a> The other is <i>Every Man Out of his Humour</i>, where
the personages go ‘up’ to the great chamber at Court.<a id="FNanchor_382" href="#Footnote_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a> Elaborate
use is also made of the upper level in <i>Antony and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span> Cleopatra</i>,
where it represents the refuge of Cleopatra upon a monument, to which
Antony is heaved up for his death scene, and on which Cleopatra is
afterwards surprised by Caesar’s troops.<a id="FNanchor_383" href="#Footnote_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a> But I do not agree
with the suggestion that it was used in shipboard scenes, for which,
as we learn from the presenter’s speeches in <i>Pericles</i>, the
stage-manager gave up the idea of providing a realistic setting, and
fell back upon an appeal to the imagination of the audience.<a id="FNanchor_384" href="#Footnote_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a> Nor
do I think that it was used for the ‘platform’ at Elsinore Castle
in <i>Hamlet</i>;<a id="FNanchor_385" href="#Footnote_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a> or, as it was in the sixteenth century, for
scenes in a Capitoline senate overlooking the forum at Rome.<a id="FNanchor_386" href="#Footnote_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a> In
<i>Bonduca</i>, if that is of our period, it was adapted for a high
rock, with fugitives upon it, in a wood.<a id="FNanchor_387" href="#Footnote_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a> I do not find extensive
chamber scenes ‘above’ in any King’s play later than 1609, and that may
be a fact of significance to which I shall return.<a id="FNanchor_388" href="#Footnote_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a> But shallow
action, at windows or in a gallery overlooking a hall or open space,
continues to be frequent.<a id="FNanchor_389" href="#Footnote_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span> In <i>The Devil is an Ass</i>, which is
a Blackfriars play of 1616, a little beyond the limits of our period,
there is an interesting scene played out of two contiguous upper
windows, supposed to be in different houses.<a id="FNanchor_390" href="#Footnote_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a></p>

<p>There is other evidence to show that in the seventeenth century as
in the sixteenth, the stage was not limited to the presentation of a
single house only at any given moment. A multiplicity of houses would
fit the needs of several plays, but perhaps the most striking instance
for the Globe is afforded by <i>The Merry Devil of Edmonton</i>, the
last act of which requires two inns on opposite sides of the stage,
the signs of which have been secretly exchanged, as a trick in the
working out of the plot.<a id="FNanchor_391" href="#Footnote_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a> The King’s plays do not often require
any marked foreshortening of distance in journeys over the stage.
Hamlet, indeed, comes in ‘a farre off’, according to a stage-direction
of the Folio, but this need mean no more than at the other end of the
graveyard, although Hamlet is in fact returning from a voyage.<a id="FNanchor_392" href="#Footnote_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a>
In <i>Bonduca</i> the Roman army at one end of the stage are said to
be half a furlong from the rock occupied by Caractacus, which they
cannot yet see; but they go off, and their leaders subsequently emerge
upon the rock from behind.<a id="FNanchor_393" href="#Footnote_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a> The old device endured at the Red
Bull, but even here the flagrant example usually cited is of a very
special type.<a id="FNanchor_394" href="#Footnote_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a> At the end of <i>The Travels of the Three English
Brothers</i>, the action of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span> which ranges widely over the inhabited
world, there is an appeal to imagination by Fame, the presenter, who
says,</p>

  <div class="poetry-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div class="i3">Would your apprehensions helpe poore art,</div>
        <div>Into three parts deuiding this our stage,</div>
        <div>They all at once shall take their leaues of you.</div>
        <div>Thinke this England, this Spaine, this Persia.</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

<p class="p-left">Then follow the stage-directions, ‘Enter three seuerall
waies the three Brothers’, and ‘Fame giues to each a prospective
glasse, they seme to see one another’. Obviously such a visionary
dumb-show cannot legitimately be twisted into an argument that the
concurrent representation of incongruous localities was a matter of
normal staging. Such interplay of opposed houses, as we get in <i>The
Merry Devil of Edmonton</i>, would no doubt seem more effective if we
could adopt the ingenious conjecture which regards the scenic wall
as not running in a straight line all the way, but broken by two
angles, so that, while the central apertures below and above directly
front the spectators, the doors to right and left, each with a room
or window above it, are set on a bias, and more or less face each
other from end to end of the stage.<a id="FNanchor_395" href="#Footnote_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a> I cannot call this more
than a conjecture, for there is no direct evidence in its favour,
and the Swan drawing, for what that is worth, is flatly against it.
Structurally it would, I suppose, fit the round or apsidal ended
Globe better than the rectangular Fortune or Blackfriars. The theory
seems to have been suggested by a desire to make it possible to watch
action within the alcove from a gallery on the level above. I have
not, however, come across any play which can be safely assigned to a
public theatre, in which just this situation presents itself, although
it is common enough for persons above to watch action in a threshold
or hall scene. Two windows in the same plane would, of course, fully
meet the needs of <i>The Devil is an Ass</i>. There is, indeed, the
often-quoted scene from <i>David and Bethsabe</i>, in which the King
watches the Hittite’s wife bathing at a fountain; but the provenance
of <i>David and Bethsabe</i> is so uncertain and its text so evidently
manipulated, that it would be very temerarious to rely upon it as
affording any proof of public usage.<a id="FNanchor_396" href="#Footnote_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a> On the other hand, if it is
the case, as seems almost certain, that the boxes over the doors were
originally the lord’s rooms, it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span> would no doubt be desirable that the
occupants of those rooms should be able to see anything that went on
within the alcove. I do not quite know what weight to attach to Mr.
Lawrence’s analogy between the oblique doors which this theory involves
and the familiar post-Restoration proscenium doors, with stage-boxes
above them, at right angles to the plane of the footlights.<a id="FNanchor_397" href="#Footnote_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a> The
roofed Caroline theatres, with their side-walls to the stage, and the
proscenium arch, probably borrowed from the masks, have intervened, and
I cannot pretend to have traced the history of theatrical structure
during the Caroline period.</p>

<p>I have felt justified in dealing more briefly with the early
seventeenth-century stages than with those of the sixteenth century,
for, after all, the fundamental conditions, so far as I can judge,
remained unaltered. I seem able to lay my finger upon two directions in
which development took place, and both of these concern the troublesome
problem of interior action. First of all there is the stage gallery. Of
this I venture to reconstruct the story as follows. Its first function
was to provide seating accommodation for dignified and privileged
spectators, amongst whom could be placed, if occasion arose, presenters
or divine agents supposed to be watching or directing the action of
a play. Perhaps a differentiation took place. Parts of the gallery,
above the doors at either end of the scene, were set aside as lord’s
rooms. The central part, with the upper floor of the tiring-house
behind it, was used for the musicians, but was also available for such
scenes as could effectively be staged above, and a curtain was fitted,
corresponding to that below, behind which the recess could be set as
a small chamber. Either as a result of these changes or for other
reasons, the lord’s rooms, about the end of the sixteenth century, lost
their popularity, and it became the fashion for persons of distinction,
or would-be distinction, to sit upon the stage itself instead.<a id="FNanchor_398" href="#Footnote_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a>
This left additional space free above, and the architects of the Globe
and Fortune took the opportunity to enlarge the accommodation for
their upper scenes. Probably they left windows over the side-doors, so
that the upper parts of three distinct houses could, if necessary, be
represented; and it may be that spectators were not wholly excluded
from these.<a id="FNanchor_399" href="#Footnote_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a> But they widened<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span> the music-room, so that it could now
hold larger scenes, and in fact now became an upper stage and not a
mere recess. Adequate lighting from behind could probably be obtained
rather more easily here than on the crowded floor below. There is an
interesting allusion which I have not yet quoted, and which seems
to point to an upper stage of substantial dimensions in the public
theatres of about the year 1607. It is in Middleton’s <i>Family of
Love</i>, itself a King’s Revels play.<a id="FNanchor_400" href="#Footnote_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a> Some of the characters have
been to a performance, not ‘by the youths’, and there ‘saw Sampson bear
the town-gates on his neck from the lower to the upper stage’. You
cannot carry a pair of town-gates into a mere box, such as the Swan
drawing shows.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, what of the alcove? I think that it proved too dark and
too cramped for the convenient handling of chamber scenes, and that
the tendency of the early seventeenth century was to confine its
use to action which could be kept shallow, or for which obscurity
was appropriate. It could still serve for a prison, or an ‘unsunned
lodge’, or a chamber of horrors. For scenes requiring more light and
movement it was replaced, sometimes by the more spacious upper stage,
sometimes by the main stage, on to which beds and other properties
were carried or ‘thrust out’, just as they had always been on a
less extensive scale for hall scenes. The difficulties of shifting
were, on the whole, compensated for by the greater effectiveness and
visibility which action on the main scene afforded. I do not therefore
think it possible to accept even such a modified version of the old
‘alternationist’ theory as I find set out in Professor Thorndike’s
recent <i>Shakespeare’s Theater</i>. The older alternationists,
starting from the principle, sound enough in itself, of continuous
action within an act, assumed that all interior or other propertied
scenes were played behind the curtains, and were set there while
unpropertied action was played outside; and they deduced a method of
dramatic construction, which required the dramatists to alternate
exterior and interior scenes so as to allow time for the settings to be
carried out.<a id="FNanchor_401" href="#Footnote_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a> The theory breaks down, not merely because it entails
a much more constant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span> use of the curtains than the stage-directions
give us any warrant for, but also because it fails to provide for the
not infrequent event of a succession of interior scenes; and in its
original form it is abandoned by Professor Thorndike in common with
other recent scholars, who see plainly enough that what I have called
hall scenes must have been given on the outer stage. I do not think
that they have always grasped that the tendency of the seventeenth
century was towards a decreased and not an increased reliance upon the
curtained space, possibly because they have not as a rule followed the
historical method in their investigations; and Professor Thorndike,
although he traces the earlier employment of the alcove much as I
do, treats the opening and closing of the curtains as coming in
time to be used, in <i>Antony and Cleopatra</i> for example and in
<i>Cymbeline</i>, as little more than a handy convention for indicating
the transference of the scene from one locality to another.<a id="FNanchor_402" href="#Footnote_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a> Such
a usage would not of course mean that the new scene was played wholly
or even partly within the alcove itself; the change might be merely one
of background. But, although I admit that there would be a convenience
in Professor Thorndike’s development, I do not see that there is in
fact any evidence for it. The stage-directions never mention the use
of curtains in such circumstances as he has in mind; and while I am
far from supposing that they need always have been mentioned, and have
myself assumed their use in one scene of <i>Cymbeline</i> where they
are not mentioned, yet mentions of them are so common in connexion with
the earlier and admitted functions of the alcove, that I should have
expected Professor Thorndike’s view, if it were sound, to have proved
capable of confirmation from at least one unconjectural case.</p>

<p>The difficulty which has led Professor Thorndike to his conclusion
is, however, a real one. In the absence of a <i>scenario</i> with
notes of locality, for which certainly there is no evidence, how
did the Elizabethan managers indicate to their audiences the shifts
of action from one place to another? This is both a sixteenth- and a
seventeenth-century problem. We have noted in a former chapter that
unity of place was characteristic of the earlier Elizabethan interlude;
that it failed to impose itself upon the romantic narrative plots
of the popular drama; that it was departed from through the device
of letting two ends of a continuously set stage stand for discrete
localities; that this device proved only a transition to a system in
which the whole stage stood successively for different localities;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
and that there are hints of a convention by which the locality of
each scene was indicated with the help of a label, placed over the
door through which the personages in that scene made their exits and
their entrances.<a id="FNanchor_403" href="#Footnote_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a> The public stage of the sixteenth and early
seventeenth centuries experienced no re-establishment of the principle
of unity; broadly speaking, it presents an extreme type of romantic
drama, with an unfettered freedom of ranging from one to another of any
number of localities required by a narrative plot. But the practice,
or the instinct, of individual playwrights differs. Ben Jonson is
naturally the man who betrays the most conscious preoccupation with the
question. He is not, however, a rigid or consistent unitarian. In his
two earliest plays the scene shifts from the country to a neighbouring
town, and the induction to <i>Every Man Out of his Humour</i> is in
part an apology for his own liberty, in part a criticism of the licence
of others.</p>

<p><i>Sejanus</i> is throughout in Rome, but five or six distinct houses
are required, and it must be doubtful whether such a multiplicity of
houses could be shown without a change of scene.<a id="FNanchor_404" href="#Footnote_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a> The prologue to
<i>Volpone</i> claims for the author that ‘The laws of time, place,
persons he obserueth’, and this has no more than four houses, all in
Venice.<a id="FNanchor_405" href="#Footnote_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a> In <i>Catiline</i> the scenes in Rome, with some ten
houses, are broken by two in open country.<a id="FNanchor_406" href="#Footnote_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a> In <i>Bartholomew
Fair</i> a preliminary act at a London<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span> house is followed by four set
continuously before the three booths of the fair. Absolute unity, as
distinct from the unity of a single country, or even a single town, is
perhaps only attained in <i>The Alchemist</i>. Here everything takes
place, either in a single room in Lovewit’s house in the Blackfriars,
or in front of a door leading from the street into the same room.
Evidently advantage was taken of the fact that the scene did not have
to be changed, to build a wall containing this door out on to the
stage itself, for action such as speaking through the keyhole requires
both sides of the door to be practicable.<a id="FNanchor_407" href="#Footnote_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a> There is also a window
from which persons approaching can be seen. Inner doors, presumably in
the scenic wall, lead to a laboratory and other parts of the house,
but these are not discovered, and no use is made of the upper level.
Jonson here is a clear innovator, so far as the English public theatre
is concerned; no other play of our period reproduces this type of
permanent interior setting.</p>

<p>Shakespeare is no classicist; yet in some of his plays, comedies and
romantic tragedies, it is, I think, possible to discern at least an
instinctive feeling in the direction of scenic unity. <i>The Comedy of
Errors</i>, with its action in the streets of Syracuse, near the mart,
or before the Phoenix, the Porpentine, or the priory, follows upon
the lines of its Latin model, although here, as in most of Jonson’s
plays, it is possible that the various houses were shown successively
rather than concurrently. <i>Twelfth Night</i>, <i>Much Ado about
Nothing</i>, and <i>Measure for Measure</i> each require a single town,
with two, three, and five houses respectively; <i>Titus Andronicus</i>,
<i>A Midsummer Night’s Dream</i>, <i>The Merry Wives of Windsor</i>,
<i>As You Like It</i>, <i>Troilus and Cressida</i>, <i>Timon of
Athens</i>, each a single town, with open country environs. <i>Love’s
Labour’s Lost</i> has the unity of a park, with perhaps a manor-house
as background at one end and tents at the other; <i>The Tempest</i>
complete pastoral unity after the opening scene on shipboard.
<i>Hamlet</i> would all be Elsinore, but for one distant open-country
scene; <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> all Venice, but for one scene in Mantua.
In another group of plays the action is divided between two towns. It
alternates from Padua to near Verona in <i>The Taming of the Shrew</i>,
from Verona to Milan in <i>The Two Gentlemen of Verona</i>, from
Venice to Belmont in <i>The Merchant of Venice</i>; in <i>Othello</i>
an act in Venice is followed by four in Cyprus. On the other hand,
in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span> a few comedies and in the histories and historical tragedies,
where Shakespeare’s sources leave him less discretion, he shifts his
scenes with a readiness outdone by no other playwright. The third act
of <i>Richard II</i> requires no less than four localities, three of
which have a castle, perhaps the same castle from the stage-manager’s
point of view, in the background. The second act of <i>1 Henry IV</i>
has as many. <i>King John</i> and <i>Henry V</i> pass lightly between
England and France, <i>All’s Well that Ends Well</i> between France
and Italy, <i>The Winter’s Tale</i> between Sicily and Bohemia,
<i>Cymbeline</i> between Britain, Italy, and Wales. Quite a late play,
<i>Antony and Cleopatra</i>, might almost be regarded as a challenge
to classicists. Rome, Misenum, Athens, Actium, Syria, Egypt are the
localities, with much further subdivision in the Egyptian scenes. The
second act has four changes of locality, the third no less than eight,
and it is noteworthy that these changes are often for quite short
bits of dialogue, which no modern manager would regard as justifying
a resetting of the stage. Shakespeare must surely have been in some
danger, in this case, of outrunning the apprehension of his auditory,
and I doubt if even Professor Thorndike’s play of curtains would have
saved him.</p>

<p>It is to be observed also that, in Shakespeare’s plays as in those of
others, no excessive pains are taken to let the changes of locality
coincide with the divisions between the acts. If the second and third
acts of <i>All’s Well that Ends Well</i> are at Paris, the fourth at
Florence, and the fifth at Marseilles, yet the shift from Roussillon to
Paris is in the middle and not at the end of the first act. The shift
from Sicily to Bohemia is in the middle of the third act of <i>The
Winter’s Tale</i>; the Agincourt scenes begin in the middle of the
third act of <i>Henry V</i>. Indeed, although the poets regarded the
acts as units of literary structure, the act-divisions do not appear
to have been greatly stressed, at any rate on the stages of the public
houses, in the actual presentation of plays.<a id="FNanchor_408" href="#Footnote_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a> I do not think that
they were wholly disregarded, although the fact that they are so often
unnoted in the prints of plays based on stage copies might point to
that conclusion.<a id="FNanchor_409" href="#Footnote_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a> The act-interval did not necessarily denote any
substantial time-interval in the action of the play, and perhaps the
actors did not invariably leave the stage. Thus the lovers in <i>A
Midsummer Night’s Dream</i> sleep through the interval between the
third and fourth acts.<a id="FNanchor_410" href="#Footnote_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a> But some sort of break in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span> continuity
of the performance is a natural inference from the fact that the
act-divisions are the favourite, although not the only, points for
the intervention of presenters, dumb-shows, and choruses.<a id="FNanchor_411" href="#Footnote_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a> The
act-intervals cannot have been long, at any rate if the performance
was to be completed in two hours. There may sometimes have been music,
which would not have prevented the audience from stretching themselves
and talking.<a id="FNanchor_412" href="#Footnote_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a> Short intervals, rather than none at all, are, I
think, suggested by the well-known passage in the induction of <i>The
Malcontent</i>, as altered for performance at the Globe, in which it
is explained that passages have been added to the play as originally
written for Revels boys, ‘to entertain a little more time, and to
abridge the not-received custom of music in our theatre’.<a id="FNanchor_413" href="#Footnote_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a> Some
information is perhaps to be gleaned from the ‘plots’ of plays prepared
for the guidance of the book-keeper or tire-man, of which examples
are preserved at Dulwich.<a id="FNanchor_414" href="#Footnote_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a> These have lines drawn across them at
points which pretty clearly correspond to the beginnings of scenes,
although it can hardly be assumed that each new scene meant a change of
locality. The act-divisions can in some, but not all, cases be inferred
from the occurrence of dumb-shows and choruses; in one, <i>The Dead
Man’s Fortune</i>, they are definitely marked by lines of crosses, and
against each such line there is the marginal note ‘musique’. Other
musical directions, ‘sound’, ‘sennet’, ‘alarum’, ‘flourish’, come
sometimes at the beginning, sometimes in the middle of scenes.</p>

<p>We do not get any encouragement to think that a change of locality was
regularly heralded by notes of music, even if this may incidentally
have been the case when a procession or an army or a monarch was about
to enter. Possibly the lines on the plots may signify an even slighter
pause than that between the acts, such as the modern stage provides<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
with the added emphasis of a drop-curtain; but of this there is no
proof, and an allusion in <i>Catiline</i> to action as rapid</p>

<p class="p-left">is distinctly against it.<a id="FNanchor_415" href="#Footnote_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a> A mere clearance of the
stage does not necessarily entail a change of scene, although there
are one or two instances in which the exit of personages at one door,
followed by their return at another, seems to constitute or accompany
such a change.<a id="FNanchor_416" href="#Footnote_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a> And even if the fact of a change could be signified
in one or other of these ways, the audience would still be in the dark
as to what the new locality was supposed to be. Can we then assume a
continuance of the old practice of indicating localities by labels over
the doors? This would entail the shifting of the labels themselves
during the progress of the play, at any rate if there were more
localities than entrances, or if, as might usually be expected, more
entrances than one were required to any locality. But there would be no
difficulty about this, and in fact we have an example of the shifting
of a label by a mechanical device in the introduction to <i>Wily
Beguiled</i>.<a id="FNanchor_417" href="#Footnote_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a> This was not a public theatre play, and the label
concerned was one giving the title of the play and not its locality,
but similar machinery could obviously have been applied. There is not,
however, much actual evidence for the use either of title-labels or
of locality-labels on the public stage. The former are perhaps the
more probable of the two, and the practice of posting play-bills at
the theatre door and in places<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span> of public resort would not render
them altogether superfluous.<a id="FNanchor_418" href="#Footnote_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a> In favour of locality-labels it is
possible to quote Dekker’s advice to those entering Paul’s, and also
the praise given to Jonson by Jasper Mayne in <i>Jonsonus Virbius</i>:</p>

  <div class="poetry-container">

<p class="p-left">These, however, are rather vague and inconclusive
allusions on which to base a whole stage practice, and there is
not much to be added to them from the texts and stage-directions
of the plays themselves. Signs are of course used to distinguish
particular taverns and shops, just as they would be in real life.<a id="FNanchor_420" href="#Footnote_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a>
Occasionally, moreover, a locality is named in a stage-direction in
a way that recalls <i>Common Conditions</i>, but this may also be
explained as no more than a descriptive touch such as is not uncommon
in stage-directions written by authors.<a id="FNanchor_421" href="#Footnote_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a> It is rather against
the theory of labels that care is often taken, when a locality is
changed, to let the personages themselves declare their whereabouts.
A careful reader of such rapidly shifting plays as <i>Edward I</i>,
<i>James IV</i>, <i>The Battle of Alcazar</i>, or <i>King Leir</i>
will generally be able to orientate himself with the aid of the
opening passages of dialogue in each new scene, and conceivably a very
attentive spectator might do the same. Once the personages have got
themselves grouped in the mind in relation to their localities, the
recurrence of this or that group would help. It would require a rather
careful examination of texts to enable one to judge how far this method
of localization by dialogue<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span> continues throughout our period. I have
been mainly struck by it in early plays. The presenters may also give
assistance, either by declaring the general scene in a prologue, or
by intervening to call attention to particular shifts.<a id="FNanchor_422" href="#Footnote_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a> Thus in
<i>Dr. Faustus</i> the original scene in Wittenberg is indicated by
the chorus, a shift to Rome by speeches of Wagner and Faustus, a shift
to the imperial court by the chorus, and the return to Wittenberg
by a speech of Faustus.<a id="FNanchor_423" href="#Footnote_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a> Jonson makes a deliberate experiment
with this method in <i>Every Man Out of his Humour</i>, which it is
worth while following in detail. It is the Grex of presenters, Mitis
and Cordatus, who serve as guides. The first act is in open country
without background, and it is left to the rustic Sogliardo to describe
it (543) as his lordship. A visit to Puntarvolo’s is arranged, and
at the beginning of the second act Cordatus says, ‘The Scene is the
countrey still, remember’ (946). Presently the stage is cleared, with
the hint, ‘Here he comes, and with him Signior Deliro a merchant, at
whose house hee is come to soiourne. Make your owne obseruation now;
only transferre your thoughts to the Cittie with the Scene; where,
suppose they speake’ (1499). The next scene then is at Deliro’s. Then,
for the first scene of the third act, ‘We must desire you to presuppose
the Stage, the middle Isle in Paules; and that, the West end of it’
(1918). The second scene of this act is in the open country again, with
a ‘crosse’ on which Sordido hangs himself; we are left to infer it from
the reappearance of the rustic characters. It is closed with ‘Let your
minde keepe companie with the Scene stil, which now remoues it selfe
from the Countrie to the Court’ (2555). After a scene at Court, ‘You
vnderstand where the scene is?’ (2709), and presumably the entry of
personages already familiar brings us back for the first scene of Act
<span class="allsmcap">IV</span> to Deliro’s. A visit to ‘the Notaries by the Exchange’ is
planned, and for the second and third scenes the only note is of the
entry of Puntarvolo and the Scrivener; probably a scrivener’s shop was
discovered. Act <span class="allsmcap">V</span> is introduced by ‘Let your imagination be
swifter than a paire of oares, and by this, suppose Puntarvolo, Briske,
Fungoso, and the Dog, arriu’d at the court gate, and going vp to the
great chamber’ (3532). The action of the next scene begins in the great
chamber and then shifts to the court gate again. Evidently the two
localities were in some way staged together, and a guide is not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span> called
upon to enlighten us. There are yet two more scenes, according to the
Grex. One opens with ‘Conceiue him but to be enter’d the Mitre’ (3841),
and as action shifts from the Mitre to Deliro’s and back again without
further note, these two houses were probably shown together. The final
scene is introduced by ‘O, this is to be imagin’d the Counter belike’
(4285). So elaborate a directory would surely render any use of labels
superfluous for this particular play; but, so far as we know, the
experiment was not repeated.<a id="FNanchor_424" href="#Footnote_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a></p>


<p>When Cordatus points to ‘that’, and calls it the west end of Paul’s,
are we to suppose that the imagination of the audience was helped out
by the display of any pictorial background? It is not impossible. The
central aperture, disclosed by the parting curtains, could easily
hold, in place of a discovered alcove or a quasi-solid monument or
rock, any kind of painted cloth which might give colour to the scene.
A woodland cloth or a battlement cloth could serve for play after
play, and for a special occasion something more distinctive could be
attempted without undue expense. Such a back-cloth, perhaps for use in
<i>Dr. Faustus</i>, may have been ‘the sittie of Rome’ which we find
in Henslowe’s inventory of 1598.<a id="FNanchor_425" href="#Footnote_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a> And something of this kind seems
to be required in <i>2 If You Know not Me, You Know Nobody</i>, where
the scene is before Sir Thomas Gresham’s newly completed Burse, and the
personages say ‘How do you like this building?’ and ‘We are gazing here
on M. Greshams work’.<a id="FNanchor_426" href="#Footnote_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a> Possibly Elizabethan imaginations were more
vivid than a tradition of scene-painters allows ours to be, but that
does not mean that an Elizabethan audience did not like to have its
eyes tickled upon occasion. And if as a rule the stage-managers relied
mainly upon garments and properties to minister to this instinct, there
is no particular reason why they should not also have had recourse
to so simple a device as a back-cloth. This conjecture is hardly
excluded by the very general terms in which post-Restoration writers
deny ‘scenes’ and all decorations other than ‘hangings’ to the earlier
stage.<a id="FNanchor_427" href="#Footnote_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a> By ‘scenes’ they no doubt mean the complete settings with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
shuttered ‘wings’ as well as back-cloths which Inigo Jones had devised
for the masks and the stage had adopted. Even these were not absolutely
unknown in pre-Restoration plays, and neither this fact nor the
incidental use of special cloths over the central aperture would make
it untrue that the normal background of an Elizabethan or Jacobean play
was an arras.<a id="FNanchor_428" href="#Footnote_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a></p>

<p>The discussions of the last chapter and a half have envisaged the
plays presented, exclusively in open theatres until the King’s took
over the Blackfriars, by professional companies of men. I must deal
in conclusion, perhaps more briefly than the interest of the problem
would itself justify, with those of the revived boy companies which for
a time carried on such an active rivalry with the men, at Paul’s from
1599 to 1606 and at the Blackfriars from 1600 to 1609. It is, I think,
a principal defect of many investigations into Jacobean staging, that
the identity of the devices employed in the so-called ‘public’ and
‘private’ houses has been too hastily assumed, and a uniform hypothesis
built up upon material taken indifferently from both sources, without
regard to the logical possibility of the considerable divergences
to which varying conditions of structure and of tradition may have
given rise. This is a kind of syncretism to which an inadequate
respect for the historic method naturally tends. It is no doubt true
that the ‘standardization’ of type, which I have accepted as likely
to result from the frequent migration of companies and plays from
one public house to another, may in a less degree have affected the
private houses also. James Burbadge originally built the Blackfriars
for public performances, and we know that <i>Satiromastix</i> was
produced both at the Globe and at Paul’s in 1601, and that in 1604 the
Revels boys and the King’s men were able to effect mutual piracies
of <i>Jeronimo</i> and <i>The Malcontent</i>. Nor is there anything
in the general character of the two groups of ‘public’ and ‘private’
plays, as they have come down to us, which is in any obvious way
inconsistent with some measure of standardization. It is apparent,
indeed, that the act-interval was of far more importance at both Paul’s
and the Blackfriars than elsewhere. But this is largely a matter of
degree. The inter-acts of music and song and dance were more universal
and longer.<a id="FNanchor_429" href="#Footnote_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a> But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span> the relation of the acts to each other was not
essentially different. The break in the representation may still
correspond to practically no interval at all in the time-distribution
of the play; and there are examples in which the action continues
to be carried on by the personages in dumb-show, while the music is
still sounding.<a id="FNanchor_430" href="#Footnote_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a> In any case this particular distinction, while it
might well modify the methods of the dramatist, need only affect the
economy of the tire-house in so far as it would give more time for the
preparation of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span> an altered setting at the beginning of an act. When
<i>The Malcontent</i> was taken over at the Globe, the text had to be
lengthened that the music might be abridged, but there is no indication
of any further alteration, due to a difficulty in adapting the original
situations to the peculiarities of the Globe stage. The types of
incident, again, which are familiar in public plays, reappear in the
private ones; in different proportions, no doubt, since the literary
interest of the dramatists and their audiences tends rather in the
directions, on the one hand of definite pastoral, and on the other of
courtly crime and urban humour, than in that of chronicle history. And
there is a marked general analogy in the stage-directions. Here also
those who leave the stage go ‘in’, and music and voices can be heard
‘within’. There are the same formulae for the use of several doors, of
which one is definitely a ‘middle’ door.<a id="FNanchor_431" href="#Footnote_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a> Spirits and so forth can
‘ascend’ from under the stage by the convenient traps.<a id="FNanchor_432" href="#Footnote_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a> Possibly
they can also ‘descend’ from the heavens.<a id="FNanchor_433" href="#Footnote_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a> The normal backing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span> of
the stage, even in out-of-door scenes, is an arras or hanging, through
which at Paul’s spectators can watch a play.<a id="FNanchor_434" href="#Footnote_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a> At the Blackfriars,
while the arras, even more clearly than in the public theatres, is of a
decorative rather than a realistic kind, it can also be helped out by
something in the nature of perspective.<a id="FNanchor_435" href="#Footnote_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a> There is action ‘above’,
and interior action, some of which is recessed or ‘discovered’. It must
be added, however, that these formulae, taken by themselves, do not go
very far towards determining the real character of the staging. They
make their first appearance, for the most part, with the interludes
in which the Court influence is paramount, and are handed down as a
tradition to the public and the private plays alike. They would hardly
have been sufficient, without the Swan drawing and other collateral
evidence, to disclose even such a general conception of the various
uses and interplay, at the Globe and elsewhere, of main stage, alcove,
and gallery, as we believe ourselves to have succeeded in adumbrating.
And it is quite possible that at Paul’s and the Blackfriars they may
not&mdash;at any rate it must not be taken for granted without inquiry that
they do&mdash;mean just the same things. Thus, to take the doors alone, we
infer with the help of the Swan drawing, that in the public<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span> theatres
the three main entrances were in the scenic wall and on the same or
nearly the same plane. But the Blackfriars was a rectangular room. We
do not know that any free space was left between its walls and the
sides of the stage. And it is quite conceivable that there may have
been side-doors in the planes of these walls, and at right angles to
the middle door. Whether this was so or not, and if so how far forward
the side-doors stood, there is certainly nothing in the formulae
of the stage-directions to tell us. Perhaps the most noticeable
differentiation, which emerges from a comparative survey of private and
public plays, is that in the main the writers of the former, unlike
those of the latter, appear to be guided by the principle of unity of
place; at any rate to the extent that their <i>domus</i> are generally
located in the same town, although they may be brought for purposes
of representation into closer contiguity than the actual topography
of that town would suggest. There are exceptions, and the scenes in a
town are occasionally broken by one or two, requiring at the most an
open-country background, in the environs. The exact measure in which
the principle is followed will become sufficiently evident in the
sequel. My immediate point is that it was precisely the absence of
unity of place which drove the public stage back upon its common form
background of a curtained alcove below and a curtained gallery above,
supplemented by the side-doors and later the windows above them, and
convertible to the needs of various localities in the course of a
single play.</p>

<p>Let us now proceed to the analysis, first of the Paul’s plays and then
of the Chapel and Revels plays at the Blackfriars; separately, for
the same caution, which forbids a hasty syncretism of the conditions
of public and private houses, also warns us that divergences may
conceivably have existed between those of the two private houses
themselves. But here too we are faced with the fact that individual
plays were sometimes transferred from one to the other, <i>The Fawn</i>
from Blackfriars to Paul’s, and <i>The Trick to Catch the Old One</i>
in its turn from Paul’s to Blackfriars.<a id="FNanchor_436" href="#Footnote_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a></p>

<p>Seventeen plays, including the two just named and <i>Satiromastix</i>,
which was shared with the Globe, are assigned to Paul’s by contemporary
title-pages.<a id="FNanchor_437" href="#Footnote_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a> To these may be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span> added, with various degrees of
plausibility, <i>Histriomastix</i>, <i>What You Will</i>, and <i>Wily
Beguiled</i>. For Paul’s were also certainly planned, although we
cannot be sure whether, or if so when, they were actually produced, the
curious series of plays left in manuscript by William Percy, of which
unfortunately only two have ever been published. As the company only
endured for six or seven years after its revival, it seems probable
that a very fair proportion of its repertory has reached us. <i>Jack
Drum’s Entertainment</i> speaks of the ‘mustie fopperies of antiquitie’
with which the company began its career, and one of these is no doubt
to be found in <i>Histriomastix</i>, evidently an old play, possibly
of academic origin, and recently brought up to date.<a id="FNanchor_438" href="#Footnote_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a> The staging
of <i>Histriomastix</i> would have caused no difficulty to the Revels
officers, if it had been put into their hands as a Paul’s play of the
’eighties. The plot illustrates the cyclical progression of Peace,
Plenty, Pride, Envy, War, Poverty, each of whom in turn occupies a
throne, finally resigned to Peace, for whom in an alternative ending
for Court performance is substituted Astraea, who is Elizabeth.<a id="FNanchor_439" href="#Footnote_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a>
This arrangement recalls that of <i>The Woman in the Moon</i>, but the
throne seems to have its position on the main stage rather than above.
Apart from the abstractions, the whole of the action may be supposed
to take place in a single provincial town, largely in an open street,
sometimes in the hall of a lord called Mavortius, on occasion in or
before smaller <i>domus</i> representing the studies of Chrisoganus,
a scholar, and Fourcher, a lawyer, the shop of Velure, a merchant, a
market-cross, which is discovered by a curtain, perhaps a tavern.<a id="FNanchor_440" href="#Footnote_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a>
Certainly in the ’eighties these would have been disposed together
around the stage, like the <i>domus</i> of <i>Campaspe</i> about
the market-place at Athens.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span> And I believe that this is in fact how
<i>Histriomastix</i> was staged, more particularly as at one point (v.
259) the action appears to pass directly from the street to the hall
without a clearance. Similarly <i>The Maid’s Metamorphosis</i> is on
strictly Lylyan lines. It is <i>tout en pastoralle</i>, in a wood,
about whose paths the characters stray, while in various regions of it
are located the cave of Somnus (<span class="allsmcap">II.</span> i. 148), the cottage of
Eurymine (<span class="allsmcap">IV.</span> ii. 4), and a palace where ‘Phoebus appeares’
(<span class="allsmcap">V.</span> ii. 25), possibly above. <i>Wily Beguiled</i> needs a
stage of which part is a wood, and part a village hard by, with some
suggestion of the doors of the houses of Gripe, Ploddall, Churms, and
Mother Midnight. Somewhat less concentration is to be found in <i>The
Wisdom of Dr. Dodipoll</i>. Here too, a space of open country, a green
hill with a cave, the harbourage and a bank, is neighboured by the
Court of Alphonso and the houses of Cassimere and of Flores, of which
the last named is adapted for interior action.<a id="FNanchor_441" href="#Footnote_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a> All this is in
Saxony, but there is also a single short scene (<span class="allsmcap">I.</span> iii) of
thirty-two lines, not necessarily requiring a background, in Brunswick.
The plays of William Percy are still, it must be admitted, rather
obscure, and one has an uneasy feeling that the manuscript may not yet
have yielded up all its indications as to date and provenance. But on
the assumption that the conditions contemplated are those of Paul’s in
1599–1606, we learn some curious details of structure, and are face
to face with a technique which is still closely reminiscent of the
’eighties. Percy, alone of the dramatists, prefixes to his books, for
the guidance of the producer, a note of the equipment required to set
them forth. Thus for <i>Cuckqueans and Cuckolds Errant</i> he writes:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="center">‘The Properties.</p>

<p>‘Harwich, In Midde of the Stage Colchester with Image of
Tarlton, Signe and Ghirlond under him also. The Raungers Lodge,
Maldon, A Ladder of Roapes trussed up neare Harwich. Highest and
Aloft the Title The Cuck-Queanes and Cuckolds Errants. A Long
Fourme.’</p>
</div>

<p class="p-left">The house at Colchester is the Tarlton Inn, and here the
ghost of Tarlton prologizes, ‘standing at entrance of the doore and
right under the Beame’. That at Harwich is the house of Floredin, and
the ladder leads to the window of his wife Arvania. Thus we have the
concurrent representation of three localities, in three distinct towns
of Essex. To each<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span> is assigned one of three doors and, as in <i>Common
Conditions</i> of old, entry by a particular door signifies that a
scene is to take place at the locality to which it belongs.<a id="FNanchor_442" href="#Footnote_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a> One is
at liberty to conjecture that the doors were nominated by labels, but
Percy does not precisely say so, although he certainly provides for a
title label. Journeys from one locality to another are foreshortened
into a crossing of the stage.<a id="FNanchor_443" href="#Footnote_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a> For <i>The Aphrodysial</i> there
were at least two houses, the palace of Oceanus ‘in the middle and
alofte’, and Proteus Hall, where interior action takes place.<a id="FNanchor_444" href="#Footnote_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a> For
<i>The Faery Pastoral</i> there is an elaborate note:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="center">‘The Properties</p>

<p>‘Highest, aloft, and on the Top of the Musick Tree the Title The
Faery Pastorall, Beneath him pind on Post of the Tree The Scene
Elvida Forrest. Lowest of all over the Canopie ΝΑΠΑΙΤΒΟΔΑΙΟΝ
or Faery Chappell. A kiln of Brick. A Fowen Cott. A Hollowe
Oake with vice of wood to shutt to. A Lowe well with Roape and
Pullye. A Fourme of Turves. A greene Bank being Pillowe to the
Hed but. Lastly A Hole to creepe in and out.’</p>
</div>

<p class="p-left">Having written so far, Percy is smitten with a doubt.
The stage of Paul’s was a small one, and spectators sat on it. If he
clutters it up like this with properties, will there be room to act at
all? He has a happy thought and continues:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘Now if so be that the Properties of any These, that be outward,
will not serve the turne by reason of concourse of the People
on the Stage, Then you may omitt the sayd Properties which be
outward and supplye their Places with their Nuncupations onely
in Text Letters. Thus for some.’</p>
</div>

<p class="p-left">Whether the master of Paul’s was prepared to avail
himself of this ingenious device, I do not know. There is no other
reference to it, and I do not think it would be safe to assume that it
was in ordinary use upon either the public or the private stage. There
is no change of locality in <i>The Faery Pastoral</i>, which is <i>tout
en pastoralle</i>, but besides the title label, there was a general
scenic label and a special one for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span> the fairy chapel. This, which had
seats on ‘degrees’ (v. 5), occupied the ‘Canopie, Fane or Trophey’,
which I take to have been a discovered interior under the ‘Beame’
named in the other play, corresponding to the alcove of the public
theatres. The other properties were smaller ‘practicables’ standing
free on the stage, which is presumably what Percy means by ‘outward’.
The arrangement must have closely resembled that of <i>The Old Wive’s
Tale</i>. The ‘Fowen Cott’ is later described as ‘tapistred with cats
and fowëns’&mdash;a gamekeeper’s larder. Some kind of action from above was
possible; it may have been only from a tree.<a id="FNanchor_445" href="#Footnote_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a></p>

<p>The plays so far considered seem to point to the use at Paul’s of
continuous settings, even when various localities had to be shown,
rather than the successive settings, with the help of common form
<i>domus</i>, which prevailed at the contemporary Globe and Fortune.
Perhaps there is rather an archaistic note about them. Let us turn to
the plays written for Paul’s by more up-to-date dramatists, by Marston,
Dekker and Webster, Chapman, Middleton, and Beaumont. Marston’s hand,
already discernible in the revision of <i>Histriomastix</i>, appears
to be dominant in <i>Jack Drum’s Entertainment</i>, although neither
play was reclaimed for him in the collected edition of 1633. Unity
of locality is not observed in <i>Jack Drum</i>. By far the greater
part of the action takes place on Highgate Green, before the house of
Sir Edward Fortune, with practicable windows above.<a id="FNanchor_446" href="#Footnote_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a> But there
are two scenes (<span class="allsmcap">I.</span> 282–428; <span class="allsmcap">IV.</span> 207–56) in London,
before a tavern (<span class="allsmcap">I.</span> 345), which may be supposed to be also
the house where Mistress Brabant lies ‘private’ in an ‘inner chamber’
(<span class="allsmcap">IV.</span> 83, 211). And there are three (<span class="allsmcap">II.</span> 170–246;
<span class="allsmcap">III.</span> 220–413; <span class="allsmcap">V</span>) in an open spot, on the way to
Highgate (<span class="allsmcap">II.</span> 228) and near a house, whence a character
emerges (<span class="allsmcap">III.</span> 249, 310). It is described as ‘the crosse stile’
(<span class="allsmcap">IV.</span> 338), and is evidently quite near Fortune’s house, and
still on the green (<span class="allsmcap">V.</span> 96, 228). This suggests to me a staging
closely analogous to that of <i>Cuckqueans and Cuckolds</i>, with
Highgate at one end of the stage, London at the other, and the cross
stile between them. It is true that there is no very certain evidence
of direct transference of action from one spot to another, but the use
of two doors at the beginning of the first London scene is consistent,
on my theory, with the fact that one entrant comes from Highgate,
whither also he goes at the end of the scene, and the similar use at
the beginning of the second cross-stile scene is consistent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span> with the
fact that the two entrants are wildly seeking the same lady, and one
may well have been in London and the other at Highgate. She herself
enters from the neighbouring house; that is to say, a third, central,
door. With Marston’s acknowledged plays, we reach an order of drama in
which interior action of the ‘hall’ type is conspicuous.<a id="FNanchor_447" href="#Footnote_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a> There are
four plays, each limited to a single Italian city, Venice or Urbino.
The main action of <i>1 Antonio and Mellida</i> is in the hall of the
doge’s palace, chiefly on ‘the lower stage’, although ladies discourse
‘above’, and a chamber can be pointed to from the hall.<a id="FNanchor_448" href="#Footnote_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a> One short
scene (<span class="allsmcap">V.</span> 1–94), although near the Court, is possibly in
the lodging of a courtier, but probably in the open street. And two
(<span class="allsmcap">III.</span> i; <span class="allsmcap">IV</span>) are in open country, representing ‘the
Venice marsh’, requiring no background, but approachable by more than
one door.<a id="FNanchor_449" href="#Footnote_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a> The setting of <i>2 Antonio and Mellida</i> is a little
more complicated. There is no open-country scene. The hall recurs and
is still the chief place of action. It can be entered by more than one
door (<span class="allsmcap">V.</span> 17, &amp;c.) and has a ‘vault’ (<span class="allsmcap">II.</span> 44) with a
‘grate’ (<span class="allsmcap">II.</span> ii. 127), whence a speaker is heard ‘under the
stage’ (<span class="allsmcap">V.</span> 1). The scenes within it include several episodes
discovered by curtains. One is at the window of Mellida’s chamber
above.<a id="FNanchor_450" href="#Footnote_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a> Another, in Maria’s chamber, where the discovery is only
of a bed, might be either above or below.<a id="FNanchor_451" href="#Footnote_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a> A third involves the
appearance of a ghost ‘betwixt the music-houses’, probably above.<a id="FNanchor_452" href="#Footnote_452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a>
Concurrently, a fourth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span> facilitates a murder in a recess below.<a id="FNanchor_453" href="#Footnote_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a>
Nor is the hall any longer the only interior used. Three scenes
(<span class="allsmcap">II.</span> 1–17; <span class="allsmcap">III.</span> 1–212; <span class="allsmcap">IV.</span> ii) are in an
aisle (<span class="allsmcap">III.</span> 128) of St. Mark’s, with a trapped grave.<a id="FNanchor_454" href="#Footnote_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a>
As a character passes (ii. 17) directly from the church to the
palace in the course of a speech, it is clear that the two ‘houses’,
consistently with actual Venetian topography, were staged together and
contiguously. <i>The Fawn</i> was originally produced at Blackfriars
and transferred to Paul’s. I deal with it here, because of the close
analogy which it presents to <i>1 Antonio and Mellida</i>. It begins
with an open-country scene within sight of the ‘far-appearing spires’
of Urbino. Thereafter all is within the hall of the Urbino palace. It
is called a ‘presence’ (<span class="allsmcap">I.</span> ii. 68), but one must conceive it
as of the nature of an Italian colonnaded <i>cortile</i>, for there
is a tree visible, up which a lover climbs to his lady’s chamber, and
although both the tree and the chamber window might have occupied a
bit of façade in the plane of the aperture showing the hall, they
appear in fact to have been within the hall, since the lovers are
later ‘discovered’ to the company there.<a id="FNanchor_455" href="#Footnote_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a> <i>What You Will</i>,
intermediate in date between <i>Antonio and Mellida</i> and <i>The
Fawn</i>, has a less concentrated setting than either of them. The
principal house is Albano’s (<span class="allsmcap">I</span>; <span class="allsmcap">III.</span> ii; <span class="allsmcap">IV</span>;
<span class="allsmcap">V.</span> 1–68), where there is action at the porch, within the hall,
and in a discovered room behind.<a id="FNanchor_456" href="#Footnote_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a> But there are also scenes in a
shop (<span class="allsmcap">III.</span> ii), in Laverdure’s lodging (<span class="allsmcap">II.</span> ii),
probably above, and in a schoolroom (<span class="allsmcap">II.</span> ii). The two latter
are also discovered.<a id="FNanchor_457" href="#Footnote_457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span> Nevertheless, I do not think that shifting
scenes of the public theatre type are indicated. Albano’s house does
not lend itself to public theatre methods. Act <span class="allsmcap">I</span> is beneath
his wife Celia’s window.<a id="FNanchor_458" href="#Footnote_458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a> Similarly <span class="allsmcap">III.</span> ii is before
his porch. But <span class="allsmcap">III.</span> iv is in his hall, whence the company go
to dinner within, and here they are disclosed in <span class="allsmcap">V.</span> Hence,
from <span class="allsmcap">V.</span> 69 onwards, they begin to pass to the street, where
they presently meet the duke’s troop. I do not know of any public play
in which the porch, the hall, and an inner room of a house are all
represented, and my feeling is that Albano’s occupied the back corner
of a stage, with the porch and window above to one side, at right
angles to the plane of the hall. At any rate I do not see any definite
obstacle to the hypothesis that all Marston’s plays for Paul’s had
continuous settings. For <i>What You Will</i> the ‘little’ stage would
have been rather crowded. The induction hints that it was, and perhaps
that spectators were on this occasion excluded, while the presenters
went behind the back curtains.</p>

<p>Most of the other Paul’s plays need not detain us as long as Marston’s.
He has been thought to have helped in <i>Satiromastix</i>, but that
must be regarded as substantially Dekker’s. Obviously it must have
been capable of representation both at Paul’s and at the Globe. It
needs the houses of Horace, Shorthose, and Vaughan, Prickshaft’s garden
with a ‘bower’ in it, and the palace. Interior action is required in
Horace’s study, which is discovered,<a id="FNanchor_459" href="#Footnote_459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a> the presence-chamber at the
palace, where a ‘chaire is set under a canopie’,<a id="FNanchor_460" href="#Footnote_460" class="fnanchor">[460]</a> and Shorthose’s
hall.<a id="FNanchor_461" href="#Footnote_461" class="fnanchor">[461]</a> The ordinary methods at the Globe would be adequate. On the
other hand, London, in spite of Horace, is the locality throughout,
and at Paul’s the setting may have been continuous, just as well as in
<i>What You Will</i>. Dekker is also the leading spirit in <i>Westward
Ho!</i> and <i>Northward Ho!</i>, and in these we get, for the first
time at Paul’s, plays for which a continuous setting seems quite
impossible. Not only does <i>Westward Ho!</i> require no less than
ten houses and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span> <i>Northward Ho!</i> seven, but also, although the
greater part of both plays takes place in London, <i>Westward Ho!</i>
has scenes at Brentford and <i>Northward Ho!</i> at Ware.<a id="FNanchor_462" href="#Footnote_462" class="fnanchor">[462]</a> The
natural conclusion is that, for these plays at least, the procedure
of the public theatres was adopted. It is, of course, the combination
of numerous houses and changes of locality which leads me to this
conclusion. Mahelot shows us that the ‘multiple’ staging of the
Hôtel de Bourgogne permitted inconsistencies of locality, but could
hardly accommodate more than five, or at most six, <i>maisons</i>.
Once given the existence of alternative methods at Paul’s, it becomes
rather difficult to say which was applied in any particular case.
Chapman’s <i>Bussy d’Ambois</i> begins, like <i>The Fawn</i>, with
an open-country scene, and thereafter uses only three houses, all in
Paris; the presence-chamber at the palace (<span class="allsmcap">I.</span> ii; <span class="allsmcap">II.</span>
i; <span class="allsmcap">III.</span> ii; <span class="allsmcap">IV.</span> i), Bussy’s chamber (<span class="allsmcap">V.</span>
iii), and Tamyra’s chamber in another house, Montsurry’s (<span class="allsmcap">II.</span>
ii; <span class="allsmcap">III.</span> i; <span class="allsmcap">IV.</span> ii; <span class="allsmcap">V.</span> i, ii, iv). Both
chambers are trapped for spirits to rise, and Tamyra’s has in it a
‘gulfe’, apparently screened by a ‘canopie’, which communicates with
Bussy’s.<a id="FNanchor_463" href="#Footnote_463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a> As the interplay of scenes in Act <span class="allsmcap">V</span> requires
transit through the passage from one chamber to the other, it is
natural to assume an unchanged setting.<a id="FNanchor_464" href="#Footnote_464" class="fnanchor">[464]</a></p>

<p>The most prolific contributor to the Paul’s repertory was Middleton.
His first play, <i>Blurt Master Constable</i>, needs five houses. They
are all in Venice, and as in certain scenes more than one of them
appears to be visible, they were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span> probably all set together.<a id="FNanchor_465" href="#Footnote_465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a>
Similarly, <i>The Phoenix</i> has six houses, all in Ferrara;<a id="FNanchor_466" href="#Footnote_466" class="fnanchor">[466]</a>
and <i>Michaelmas Term</i> has five houses, all in London.<a id="FNanchor_467" href="#Footnote_467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a> On
the other hand, although <i>A Mad World, my Masters</i> has only four
houses,<a id="FNanchor_468" href="#Footnote_468" class="fnanchor">[468]</a> and <i>A Trick to Catch the Old One</i> seven,<a id="FNanchor_469" href="#Footnote_469" class="fnanchor">[469]</a> yet
both these plays resemble Dekker’s, in that the action is divided
between London and one or more places in the country; and this, so far
as it goes, seems to suggest settings on public theatre lines. I do
not know whether Middleton wrote <i>The Puritan</i>, but I think that
this play clearly had a continuous setting with only four houses, in
London.<a id="FNanchor_470" href="#Footnote_470" class="fnanchor">[470]</a> And although Beaumont’s <i>Woman Hater</i> requires<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span> seven
houses, these are all within or hard by the palace in Milan, and action
seems to pass freely from one to another.<a id="FNanchor_471" href="#Footnote_471" class="fnanchor">[471]</a></p>

<p>The evidence available does not dispose one to dogmatism. But this
is the general impression which I get of the history of the Paul’s
staging. When the performances were revived in 1599, the master had,
as in the days before Lyly took the boys to Blackfriars, to make the
best of a room originally designed for choir-practices. This was
circular, and only had space for a comparatively small stage. At the
back of this, entrance was given by a curtained recess, corresponding
to the alcove of the public theatres, and known at Paul’s as the
‘canopy’.<a id="FNanchor_472" href="#Footnote_472" class="fnanchor">[472]</a> Above the canopy was a beam, which bore the post of the
music-tree. On this post was a small stand, perhaps for the conductor
of the music, and on each side of it was a music-house, forming a
gallery,<a id="FNanchor_473" href="#Footnote_473" class="fnanchor">[473]</a> which could represent a window or balcony. There were
at least two other doors, either beneath the music-houses or at right
angles to these, off the sides of the stage. The master began with
continuous settings on the earlier sixteenth-century court model, using
the doors and galleries as far as he could to represent houses, and
supplementing these by temporary structures; and this plan fitted in
with the general literary trend of his typical dramatists, especially
Marston, to unity of locality. But in time the romantic element proved
too much for him, and when he wanted to enlist the services of writers
of the popular school, such as Dekker, he had to compromise. It may
be that some structural change was carried out during the enforced
suspension of performances in 1603. I do not think that there is any
Paul’s play of earlier date which could not have been given in the
old-fashioned manner. In any event, the increased number of houses and
the not infrequent shiftings of locality from town to country, which
are apparent in the Jacobean plays, seem to me, taken together, to be
more than can be accounted for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span> on a theory of clumsy foreshortening,
and to imply the adoption, either generally or occasionally, of some
such principle of convertible houses, as was already in full swing upon
the public stage.<a id="FNanchor_474" href="#Footnote_474" class="fnanchor">[474]</a></p>

<p>I do not think that the history of the Blackfriars was materially
different from that of Paul’s. There are in all twenty-four plays
to be considered; an Elizabethan group of seven produced by the
Children of the Chapel, and a Jacobean group of seventeen produced by
the successive incarnations of the Revels company.<a id="FNanchor_475" href="#Footnote_475" class="fnanchor">[475]</a> Structural
alterations during 1603 are here less probable, for the house only
dated from Burbadge’s enterprise of 1596. Burbadge is said to have
intended a ‘public’ theatre, and it may be argued on <i>a priori</i>
grounds that he would have planned for the type of staging familiar
to him at the Theatre and subsequently elaborated at the Globe. The
actual character of the plays does not, however, bear out this view.
Like Paul’s, the Blackfriars relied at first in part upon revivals.
One was <i>Love’s Metamorphosis</i>, already produced by Lyly under
Court conditions with the earlier Paul’s boys, and <i>tout en
pastoralle</i>.<a id="FNanchor_476" href="#Footnote_476" class="fnanchor">[476]</a> Another, or if not, quite an archaistic play, was
<i>Liberality and Prodigality</i>, the abstract plot of which only
needs an equally abstract scene, with a ‘bower’ for Fortune, holding
a throne and scaleable by a ladder (30, 290, 903, 932, 953), another
‘bower’ for Virtue (132), an inn (47, 192, 370), and a high seat for a
judge with his clerks beneath him (1245).<a id="FNanchor_477" href="#Footnote_477" class="fnanchor">[477]</a> The two new playwrights
may reasonably be supposed to have conformed to the traditional
methods. Jonson’s <i>Cynthia’s Revels</i> has a preliminary act of open
country, by the Fountain of Self-Love, in Gargaphia. The rest is all at
the Gargaphian palace, either in the presence, or in an ante-chamber
thereto, perhaps before a curtain, or for one or two scenes in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
nymphs’ chamber (<span class="allsmcap">IV.</span> i-v), and in or before the chamber of
Asotus (<span class="allsmcap">III.</span> v).<a id="FNanchor_478" href="#Footnote_478" class="fnanchor">[478]</a> <i>Poetaster</i> is all at Rome, within
and before the palace, the houses of Albius and Lupus, and the chamber
of Ovid.<a id="FNanchor_479" href="#Footnote_479" class="fnanchor">[479]</a> There is certainly no need for any shifting of scenes so
far. Nor does Chapman demand it. <i>Sir Giles Goosecap</i>, except for
one open-country scene, has only two houses, which are demonstrably
contiguous and used together.<a id="FNanchor_480" href="#Footnote_480" class="fnanchor">[480]</a> <i>The Gentleman Usher</i> has only
two houses, supposed to be at a little distance from each other, and
entailing a slight foreshortening, if they were placed at opposite ends
of the stage.<a id="FNanchor_481" href="#Footnote_481" class="fnanchor">[481]</a> <i>All Fools</i> adopts the Italian convention of
action in an open city space before three houses.<a id="FNanchor_482" href="#Footnote_482" class="fnanchor">[482]</a></p>

<p>To the Jacobean repertory not less than nine writers contributed.
Chapman still takes the lead with three more comedies and two tragedies
of his own. In the comedies he tends somewhat to increase the number
of his houses, although without any change of general locality. <i>M.
d’Olive</i> has five houses.<a id="FNanchor_483" href="#Footnote_483" class="fnanchor">[483]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span> <i>May Day</i> has four.<a id="FNanchor_484" href="#Footnote_484" class="fnanchor">[484]</a> <i>The
Widow’s Tears</i> has four.<a id="FNanchor_485" href="#Footnote_485" class="fnanchor">[485]</a> But in all cases there is a good
deal of interplay of action between one house and another, and all
the probabilities are in favour of continuous setting. The tragedies
are perhaps another matter. The houses are still not numerous; but
the action is in each play divided between two localities. The
<i>Conspiracy of Byron</i> is partly at Paris and partly at Brussels;
the <i>Tragedy of Byron</i> partly at Paris and partly at Dijon.<a id="FNanchor_486" href="#Footnote_486" class="fnanchor">[486]</a>
Jonson’s <i>Case is Altered</i> has one open-country scene (<span class="allsmcap">V.</span>
iv) near Milan. The other scenes require two houses within the city.
One is Farneze’s palace, with a <i>cortile</i> where servants come
and go, and a colonnade affording a private ‘walk’ for his daughters
(<span class="allsmcap">II.</span> iii; <span class="allsmcap">IV.</span> i). Hard by, and probably in Italian
fashion forming part of the structure of the palace itself, is the
cobbler’s shop of Farneze’s retainer, Juniper.<a id="FNanchor_487" href="#Footnote_487" class="fnanchor">[487]</a> Near, too, is the
house of Jaques, with a little walled backside, and a tree in it.<a id="FNanchor_488" href="#Footnote_488" class="fnanchor">[488]</a>
A link with Paul’s is provided by three Blackfriars plays from Marston.
Of these, the <i>Malcontent</i> is in his characteristic Italian
manner. There is a short hunting scene (<span class="allsmcap">III.</span> ii) in the middle
of the play. For nearly all the rest the scene is the ‘great chamber’
in the palace at Genoa, with a door to the apartment of the duchess
at the back (<span class="allsmcap">II.</span> i. 1) and the chamber of Malevole visible
above.<a id="FNanchor_489" href="#Footnote_489" class="fnanchor">[489]</a> Part<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span> of the last act, however, is before the citadel
of Genoa, from which the action passes direct to the palace.<a id="FNanchor_490" href="#Footnote_490" class="fnanchor">[490]</a>
<i>The Dutch Courtesan</i> is a London comedy with four houses, of
the same type as <i>What You Will</i>, but less crowded.<a id="FNanchor_491" href="#Footnote_491" class="fnanchor">[491]</a> In the
tragedy of <i>Sophonisba</i>, on the other hand, we come for the first
time at Blackfriars to a piece which seems hopelessly unamenable to
continuous setting. It recalls the structure of such early public plays
as the <i>Battle of Alcazar</i>. ‘The scene is Libya’, the prologue
tells us. We get the camps of Massinissa (<span class="allsmcap">II.</span> ii), Asdrubal
(<span class="allsmcap">II.</span> iii), and Scipio (<span class="allsmcap">III.</span> ii; <span class="allsmcap">V.</span> iv). We
get a battle-field with a ‘mount’ and a ‘throne’ in it (<span class="allsmcap">V.</span>
ii). We get the forest of Belos, with a cave’s mouth (<span class="allsmcap">IV.</span> i).
The city scenes are divided between Carthage and Cirta. At Carthage
there is a council-chamber (<span class="allsmcap">II.</span> i) and also the chamber of
Sophonisba (<span class="allsmcap">I.</span> ii), where her bed is ‘discovered’.<a id="FNanchor_492" href="#Footnote_492" class="fnanchor">[492]</a>
At Cirta there is the similar chamber of Syphax (<span class="allsmcap">III.</span> i;
<span class="allsmcap">IV.</span> ii) with a trapped altar.<a id="FNanchor_493" href="#Footnote_493" class="fnanchor">[493]</a> A curious bit of continuous
action, difficult to envisage, comprehends this and the forest at the
junction of Acts <span class="allsmcap">IV</span> and <span class="allsmcap">V</span>. From a vault within it, a
passage leads to the cave. Down this, in <span class="allsmcap">III.</span> i, Sophonisba
descends, followed by Syphax. A camp scene intervenes, and at the
beginning of <span class="allsmcap">IV</span> Sophonisba emerges in the forest, is overtaken
by Syphax, and sent back to Cirta. Then Syphax remembers that ‘in this
desert’ lives the witch Erichtho. She enters, and promises to charm
Sophonisba to his bed. Quite suddenly, and without any <i>Exit</i> or
other indication of a change of locality, we are back in the chamber
at Cirta. Music sounds within ‘the canopy’ and ‘above’. Erichtho,
disguised as Sophonisba, enters the canopy, as to bed. Syphax<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
follows, and only discovers his misadventure at the beginning of Act
<span class="allsmcap">V</span>.<a id="FNanchor_494" href="#Footnote_494" class="fnanchor">[494]</a> Even if the play was staged as a whole on public
theatre methods, it is difficult not to suppose that the two entrances
to the cave, at Cirta and in the forest, were shown together. It is
to be added that, in a note to the print, Marston apologizes for ‘the
fashion of the entrances’ on the ground that the play was ‘presented
by youths and after the fashion of the private stage’. Somewhat
exceptional also is the arrangement of <i>Eastward Ho!</i>, in which
Chapman, Jonson, and Marston collaborated. The first three acts, taken
by themselves, are easy enough. They need four houses in London. The
most important is Touchstone’s shop, which is ‘discovered’.<a id="FNanchor_495" href="#Footnote_495" class="fnanchor">[495]</a> The
others are the exteriors of Sir Petronel’s house and Security’s house,
with a window or balcony above, and a room in the Blue Anchor tavern
at Billingsgate.<a id="FNanchor_496" href="#Footnote_496" class="fnanchor">[496]</a> But throughout most of Act <span class="allsmcap">IV</span> the whole
stage seems to be devoted to a complicated action, for which only
one of these houses, the Blue Anchor, is required. A place above the
stage represents Cuckold’s Haven, on the Surrey side of the Thames
near Rotherhithe, where stood a pole bearing a pair of ox-horns, to
which butchers did a folk-observance. Hither climbs Slitgut, and
describes the wreck of a boat in the river beneath him.<a id="FNanchor_497" href="#Footnote_497" class="fnanchor">[497]</a> It is
the boat in which an elopement was planned from the Blue Anchor in
Act <span class="allsmcap">III</span>. Slitgut sees<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span> passengers landed successively ‘even
just under me’, and then at St. Katharine’s, Wapping, and the Isle of
Dogs. These are three places on the north bank, all to the east of
Billingsgate and on the other side of the Tower, but as each rescue is
described, the passengers enter the stage, and go off again. Evidently
a wild foreshortening is deliberately involved. Now, although the
print obscures the fact, must begin a new scene.<a id="FNanchor_498" href="#Footnote_498" class="fnanchor">[498]</a> A night has
passed, and Winifred, who landed at St. Katharine’s, returns to the
stage, and is now before the Blue Anchor.<a id="FNanchor_499" href="#Footnote_499" class="fnanchor">[499]</a> From <span class="allsmcap">IV.</span> ii
onwards the setting is normal again, with three houses, of which one is
Touchstone’s. But the others are now the exterior of the Counter and
of the lodging of Gertrude. One must conclude that in this play the
Blackfriars management was trying an experiment, and made complete, or
nearly complete, changes of setting, at the end of Act <span class="allsmcap">III</span>
and again after <span class="allsmcap">IV.</span> i. Touchstone’s, which was discovered,
could be covered again. The other houses, except the tavern, were
represented by mere doors or windows, and gave no trouble. The
tavern, the introduction of which in the early acts already entailed
foreshortening, was allowed to stand for <span class="allsmcap">IV.</span> i, and was then
removed, while Touchstone’s was discovered again.</p>

<p>Middleton’s tendency to multiply his houses is noticeable, as at
Paul’s, in <i>Your Five Gallants</i>. There are eight, in London, with
an open-country scene in Combe Park (<span class="allsmcap">III.</span> ii, iii), and one
cannot be confident of continuous setting.<a id="FNanchor_500" href="#Footnote_500" class="fnanchor">[500]</a> But a group of new
writers, enlisted at Blackfriars in Jacobean days, conform well enough
to the old traditions of the house. Daniel’s <i>Philotas</i> has the
abstract stage characteristic of the closet tragedies to the type of
which it really belongs. Any Renaissance façade would do; at most a
hall in the court and the lodging of Philotas need be distinguished.
Day’s <i>Isle of Gulls</i> is <i>tout en pastoralle</i>.<a id="FNanchor_501" href="#Footnote_501" class="fnanchor">[501]</a> His
<i>Law Tricks</i> has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span> only four houses, in Genoa.<a id="FNanchor_502" href="#Footnote_502" class="fnanchor">[502]</a> Sharpham’s
<i>Fleir</i>, after a prelude at Florence, which needs no house, has
anything from three to six in London.<a id="FNanchor_503" href="#Footnote_503" class="fnanchor">[503]</a> Fletcher’s <i>Faithful
Shepherdess</i>, again, is <i>tout en pastoralle</i>.<a id="FNanchor_504" href="#Footnote_504" class="fnanchor">[504]</a> Finally,
<i>The Knight of the Burning Pestle</i> is, in the strict sense, an
exception which proves the rule. Its shifts of locality are part of the
burlesque, in which the popular plays are taken off for the amusement
of the select audience of the Blackfriars. Its legitimate houses are
only two, Venturewell’s shop and Merrithought’s dwelling, hard by one
another.<a id="FNanchor_505" href="#Footnote_505" class="fnanchor">[505]</a> But the adventures of the prentice heroes take them not
only over down and through forest to Waltham, where the Bell Inn must
serve for a knightly castle, and the barber’s shop for Barbaroso’s
cave, but also to the court of Moldavia, although the players regret
that they cannot oblige the Citizen’s Wife by showing a house covered
with black velvet and a king’s daughter standing in her window all in
beaten gold, combing her golden locks with a comb of ivory.<a id="FNanchor_506" href="#Footnote_506" class="fnanchor">[506]</a> What
visible parody of public stage methods heightened the fun, it is of
course impossible to say.</p>

<p>I do not propose to follow the Queen’s Revels to the Whitefriars, or
to attempt any investigation into the characteristics of that house.
It was occupied by the King’s Revels before the Queen’s Revels, and
probably the Lady Elizabeth’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span> joined the Queen’s Revels there at a
later date. But the number of plays which can definitely be assigned
to it is clearly too small to form the basis of any satisfactory
induction.<a id="FNanchor_507" href="#Footnote_507" class="fnanchor">[507]</a> So far as the Blackfriars is concerned, my conclusion
must be much the same as for Paul’s&mdash;that, when plays began in 1600,
the Chapel revived the methods of staging with which their predecessors
had been familiar during the hey-day of the Court drama under Lyly;
that these methods held their own in the competition with the public
theatres, and were handed on to the Queen’s Revels; but that in
course of time they were sometimes variegated by the introduction,
for one reason or another, of some measure of scene-shifting in
individual plays. This reason may have been the nature of the plot in
<i>Sophonisba</i>, the desire to experiment in <i>Eastward Ho!</i>,
the restlessness of the dramatist in <i>Your Five Gallants</i>, the
spirit of raillery in <i>The Knight of the Burning Pestle</i>. Whether
Chapman’s tragedies involved scene-shifting, I am not quite sure. The
analogy of the Hôtel de Bourgogne, where a continuous setting was not
inconsistent with the use of widely distant localities, must always
be kept in mind. On the other hand, what did not appear absurd in
Paris, might have appeared absurd in London, where the practice of the
public theatres had taught the spectators to expect a higher degree of
consistency. I am far from claiming that my theory of the survival of
continuous setting at Paul’s and the Blackfriars has been demonstrated.
Very possibly the matter is not capable of demonstration. Many, perhaps
most, of the plays could be produced, if need be, by alternative
methods. It is really on taking them in the mass that I cannot resist
the feeling that ‘the fashion of the private stage’, as Marston called
it, was something different from the fashion of the public stage. The
technique of the dramatists corresponds to the structural conditions.
An increased respect for unity of place is not the only factor,
although it is the most important. An unnecessary multiplicity of
houses is, except by Dekker and Middleton, avoided. Sometimes one or
two suffice. There is much more interior action than in the popular
plays. One hall or chamber scene can follow upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span> another more freely.
A house may be used for a scene which would seem absurdly short if the
setting were altered for it. More doors are perhaps available, so that
some can be spared for entrance behind the houses. There is more coming
and going between one house and another, although I have made it clear
that even the public stage was not limited to one house at a time.<a id="FNanchor_508" href="#Footnote_508" class="fnanchor">[508]</a>
One point is, I think, quite demonstrable. Marston has a reference
to ‘the lower stage’ at Paul’s, but neither at Paul’s nor at the
Blackfriars was there an upper stage capable of holding the action of
a complete scene, such as we found at the sixteenth-century theatres,
and apparently on a still larger scale at the Globe and the Fortune.
A review of my notes will show that, although there is action ‘above’
in many private house plays, it is generally a very slight action,
amounting to little more than the use by one or two persons of a window
or balcony. Bedchamber scenes or tavern scenes are provided for below;
the public theatre, as often as not, put them above.<a id="FNanchor_509" href="#Footnote_509" class="fnanchor">[509]</a> I may recall,
in confirmation, that the importance of the upper stage in the plays
of the King’s men sensibly diminishes after their occupation of the
Blackfriars.<a id="FNanchor_510" href="#Footnote_510" class="fnanchor">[510]</a></p>

<p>There are enigmas still to be solved, and I fear insoluble. Were the
continuous settings of the type which we find in Serlio, with the unity
of a consistent architectural picture, or of the type which we find
at the Hôtel de Bourgogne, with independent and sometimes incongruous
juxtaposed <i>mansions</i>? The taste of the dramatists for Italian
cities and the frequent recurrence of buildings which fit so well
into a Serliesque scheme as the tavern, the shop, the house of the
<i>ruffiana</i> or courtesan, may tempt one’s imagination towards the
former. But Serlio does not seem to contemplate much interior action,
and although the convention of a half out-of-doors <i>cortile</i> or
<i>loggia</i> may help to get over this difficulty, the often crowded
presences and the masks seem to call for an arrangement by which each
<i>mansion</i> can at need become in its turn the background to the
whole of the stage and attach to itself all the external doors. How
were the open-country scenes managed, which we have noticed in several
plays, as a prelude, or even an interruption, to the strict<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span> unity
of place?<a id="FNanchor_511" href="#Footnote_511" class="fnanchor">[511]</a> Were these merely played on the edge of the stage, or
are we to assume a curtain, cutting off the background of houses, and
perhaps painted with an open-country or other appropriate perspective?
And what use, if any, can we suppose to have been made of title or
locality labels? The latter would not have had much point where the
locality was unchanged; but Envy calls out ‘Rome’ three times in
the prologue to the <i>Poetaster</i>, as if she saw it written up
in three places. Percy may more naturally use them in <i>Cuckqueans
and Cuckolds</i>, on a stage which represents a foreshortening of
the distance between three distinct towns. Title-labels seem fairly
probable. <i>Cynthia’s Revels</i> and <i>The Knight of the Burning
Pestle</i> bear testimony to them at the Blackfriars; <i>Wily
Beguiled</i> perhaps at Paul’s.<a id="FNanchor_512" href="#Footnote_512" class="fnanchor">[512]</a> And if the prologues none the
less thought it necessary to announce ‘The scene is Libya’, or ‘The
scene Gargaphia, which I do vehemently suspect for some fustian
country’, why, we must remember that there were many, even in a select
Elizabethan audience, that could not hope to be saved by their book.</p>

<p>[<i>Bibliographical Note.</i>&mdash;The records of the Stationers’
Company were utilized by W. Herbert in <i>Typographical
Antiquities</i> (1785–90), based on an earlier edition (1749) by
J. Ames, and revised, but not for the period most important to
us, by T. F. Dibdin (1810–19). They are now largely available
at first hand in E. Arber, <i>Transcript of the Registers of
the Stationers’ Company, 1554–1640</i> (1875–94), and G. E.
B. Eyre, <i>Transcript of the Registers of the Worshipful
Company of Stationers, 1640–1708</i> (1913–14). Recent
investigations are to be found in the <i>Transactions</i> and
other publications of the Bibliographical Society, and in the
periodicals <i>Bibliographica</i> and <i>The Library</i>. The
best historical sketches are H. R. Plomer, <i>A Short History
of English Printing</i> (1900), E. G. Duff, <i>The Introduction
of Printing into England</i> (1908, <i>C. H.</i> ii. 310), H.
G. Aldis, <i>The Book-Trade, 1557–1625</i> (1909, <i>C. H.</i>
iv. 378), and R. B. McKerrow, <i>Booksellers, Printers, and the
Stationers’ Trade</i> (1916, <i>Sh. England</i>, ii. 212). Of
somewhat wider range is H. G. Aldis, <i>The Printed Book</i>
(1916). Records of individual printers are in E. G. Duff,
<i>A Century of the English Book Trade, 1457–1557</i> (1905),
R. B. McKerrow, <i>Dictionary of Printers and Booksellers,
1557–1640</i> (1910), and H. R. Plomer, <i>Dictionary of
Booksellers and Printers, 1641–67</i> (1907). Special studies
of value are R. B. McKerrow, <i>Printers and Publishers’
Devices</i> (1913), and <i>Notes on Bibliographical Evidence
for Literary Students</i> (1914). P. Sheavyn, <i>The Literary
Profession in the Elizabethan Age</i> (1909), is not very
accurate. The early history of the High Commission (1558–64) is
studied in H. Gee, <i>The Elizabethan Clergy and the Settlement
of Religion</i> (1898). The later period awaits fuller treatment
than that in <i>An Account of the Courts Ecclesiastical</i> by
W. Stubbs in the <i>Report of the Commission on Ecclesiastical
Courts</i> (1883), i. 21. J. S. Burn, <i>The High Commission</i>
(1865), is scrappy.</p>

<p>For plays in particular, W. W. Greg, <i>List of English
Plays</i> (1900), gives the title-pages, and Arber the
registration entries. Various problems are discussed by A.
W. Pollard, <i>Shakespeare Folios and Quartos</i> (1909) and
<i>Shakespeare’s Fight with the Pirates</i> (1917, ed. 2, 1920),
and in connexion with the Shakespearian quartos of 1619 (cf. ch.
xxiii). New ground is opened by A. W. Pollard and J. D. Wilson,
<i>The ‘Stolne and Surreptitious’ Shakespearian Texts</i>
(<i>T. L. S.</i> Jan.–Aug. 1919), and J. D. Wilson, <i>The
Copy for Hamlet, 1603, and the Hamlet Transcript, 1593</i>
(1918). Other studies are C. Dewischeit, <i>Shakespeare und
die Stenographie</i> (1898, <i>Jahrbuch</i>, xxxiv. 170), B.
A. P. van Dam and C. Stoffel, <i>William Shakespeare, Prosody
and Text</i> (1900), <i>Chapters in English Printing, Prosody,
and Pronunciation</i> (1902), P. Simpson, <i>Shakespearian
Punctuation</i> (1911), E. M. Albright, ‘<i>To be Staied</i>’
(1915, <i>M. L. A.</i> xxx. 451; cf. <i>M. L. N.</i>, Feb.
1919), A. W. Pollard, <i>Ad Imprimendum Solum</i> (1919, <i>3
Library</i>, x. 57), H. R. Shipheard, <i>Play-Publishing in
Elizabethan Times</i> (1919, <i>M. L. A.</i> xxxiv. 580); M. A.
Bayfield, <i>Shakespeare’s Versification</i> (1920); cf. <i>T.
L. S.</i> (1919–20).</p>

<p>The nature of stage-directions is considered in many
works on staging (cf. <i>Bibl. Note</i> to ch. xviii),
and in N. Delius, <i>Die Bühnenweisungen in den alten
Shakespeare-Ausgaben</i> (1873, <i>Jahrbuch</i>, viii. 171),
R. Koppel, <i>Scenen-Einteilung und Orts-Angaben in den
Shakespeareschen Dramen</i> (1874, <i>Jahrbuch</i>, ix. 269),
<i>Die unkritische Behandlung dramaturgischer Angaben<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span> und
Anordnungen in den Shakespeare-Ausgaben</i> (1904, <i>E. S.</i>
xxxiv. 1). The documents printed by Arber are so fundamental as
to justify a short description. Each of his vols. i-iv gives the
text, or most of the text, of four books, lettered A-D in the
Company’s archives, interspersed with illustrative documents
from other sources; vol. v consists of indices. Another series
of books, containing minutes of the Court of Assistants from
1603 onwards, remains unprinted (ii. 879). Book A contains the
annual accounts of the wardens from 1554 to 1596. The Company’s
year began on varying dates in the first half of July. From
1557 to 1571 the accounts include detailed entries of the books
for which fees were received and of the fines imposed upon
members of the Company for irregularities. Thereafter they are
abstracts only, and reference is made for the details of fees
to ‘the register in the clarkes booke’ (i. 451). Unfortunately
this book is not extant for 1571–6. After the appointment of
Richard Collins in place of George Wapull as clerk in 1575, a
new ‘booke of entrances’ was bought for the clerk (i. 475).
This is Book B, which is divided into sections for records of
different character, including book entries for 1576–95, and
fines for 1576–1605. There are also some decrees and ordinances
of the Court, most of which Arber does not print, and a few
pages of miscellaneous memoranda at the beginning and end (ii.
33–49, 884–6). Book C, bought ‘for the entrance of copies’ in
1594–5 (i. 572), has similar memoranda (iii. 35–8, 677–98). It
continues the book entries, and these alone, for 1595–1620. Book
D continues them for 1620–45. Arber’s work stops at 1640. Eyre
prints a transcript by H. R. Plomer of the rest of D and of
Books E, F, and G, extending to 1708.]</p>

<p>A historian of the stage owes so much of his material to the printed
copies of plays, with their title-pages, their prefatory epistles, and
their stage-directions, that he can hardly be dispensed from giving
some account of the process by which plays got into print. Otherwise
I should have been abundantly content to have left the subject with a
reference to the researches of others, and notably of that accomplished
bibliographer, my friend Mr. A. W. Pollard, to whom in any event the
debt of these pages must be great. The earliest attempts to control
the book-trade are of the nature of commercial restrictions, and
concern themselves with the regulation of alien craftsmanship.<a id="FNanchor_513" href="#Footnote_513" class="fnanchor">[513]</a>
But when Tudor policy had to deal with expressions of political and
religious opinion, and in particular when the interlude as well as the
pamphlet, not without encouragement from Cranmer and Cromwell, became
an instrument of ecclesiastical controversy, it was not long before the
State found itself committed to the methods of a literary censorship.
We have already followed in detail the phases of the control to which
the spoken play was subjected.<a id="FNanchor_514" href="#Footnote_514" class="fnanchor">[514]</a> The story of the printed play
was closely analogous; and in both cases the ultimate term of the
evolution, so far as our period is concerned, was the establishment of
the authority of the Master of the Revels. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span> printing and selling
of plays, however, was of course only one fragment of the general
business of book-production. Censorship was applied to many kinds of
books, and was also in practice closely bound up with the logically
distinct problem of copyright. This to the Elizabethan mind was a
principle debarring one publisher from producing and selling a book in
which another member of his trade had already a vested interest. The
conception of a copyright vested in the author as distinct from the
publisher of a book had as yet hardly emerged.</p>

<p>The earliest essay in censorship in fact took the form of an extension
of the procedure, under which protection had for some time past been
given to the copyright in individual books through the issue of a
royal privilege forbidding their republication by any other than the
privileged owner or printer.<a id="FNanchor_515" href="#Footnote_515" class="fnanchor">[515]</a> Three proclamations of Henry VIII
against heretical or seditious books, in 1529, 1530, and 1536, were
followed in 1538 by a fourth, which forbade the printing of any English
book except with a licence given ‘upon examination made by some of his
gracis priuie counsayle, or other suche as his highnes shall appoynte’,
and further directed that a book so licensed should not bear the words
‘Cum priuilegio regali’ without the addition of ‘ad imprimendum solum’,
and that ‘the hole copie, or els at the least theffect of his licence
and priuilege be therwith printed’.<a id="FNanchor_516" href="#Footnote_516" class="fnanchor">[516]</a> The intention was apparently
to distinguish between a merely regulative privilege or licence to
print, and the older and fuller type of privilege which also conveyed
a protection of copyright. Finally, in 1546, a fifth proclamation
laid down that every ‘Englishe boke, balet or playe’ must bear the
names of the printer and author and the ‘daye of the printe’, and that
an advance copy must be placed in the hands of the local mayor two
days before publication.<a id="FNanchor_517" href="#Footnote_517" class="fnanchor">[517]</a> It is not quite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span> clear whether these
requirements were intended to replace, or merely to reinforce, that of
a licence. Henry’s proclamations lost their validity upon his death
in 1547, but the policy of licensing was continued by his successors.
Under Edward VI we get, first a Privy Council order of 1549, directing
that all English books printed or sold should be examined and allowed
by ‘M<sup>r</sup> Secretary Peter, M<sup>r</sup> Secretary Smith and M<sup>r</sup> Cicill, or the
one of them’, and secondly a proclamation of 1551, requiring allowance
‘by his maiestie, or his priuie counsayl in writing signed with his
maiesties most gratious hand or the handes of sixe of his sayd priuie
counsayl’.<a id="FNanchor_518" href="#Footnote_518" class="fnanchor">[518]</a> Mary in her turn, though with a different emphasis
on the kind of opinion to be suppressed, issued three proclamations
against heretical books in 1553, 1555, and 1558, and in the first of
these limited printers to books for which they had ‘her graces speciall
licence in writynge’.<a id="FNanchor_519" href="#Footnote_519" class="fnanchor">[519]</a> It is noteworthy that both in 1551 and in
1553 the printing and the playing of interludes were put upon exactly
the same footing.</p>

<p>Mary, however, took another step of the first importance for the
further history of publishing, by the grant on 4 May 1557 a charter of
incorporation to the London Company of Stationers.<a id="FNanchor_520" href="#Footnote_520" class="fnanchor">[520]</a> This was an
old organization, traceable as far back as 1404.<a id="FNanchor_521" href="#Footnote_521" class="fnanchor">[521]</a> By the sixteenth
century it had come to include the printers who manufactured, as
well as the stationers who sold, books; and many, although not all
of its members, exercised both avocations. No doubt the issue of the
charter had its origin in mixed motives. The stationers wanted the
status and the powers of economic regulation within their trade which
it conferred; the Government wanted the aid of the stationers in
establishing a more effective control over the printed promulgation
of inconvenient doctrines. This preoccupation is clearly manifested
in the preamble to the charter, with its assertion that ‘seueral
seditious and heretical books’ are ‘daily published’; and the objects
of both parties were met by a provision that ‘no person shall practise
or exercise the art or mystery of printing or stamping any book
unless the same person is, or shall be,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span> one of the society of the
foresaid mystery of a stationer of the city aforesaid, or has for that
purpose obtained our licence’. This practically freed the associated
stationers from any danger of outside competition, and it immensely
simplified the task of the heresy hunters by enlisting the help of
the Company against the establishment of printing-presses by any but
well-known and responsible craftsmen. Registration is always half-way
towards regulation. The charter did not, however, dispense, even
for the members of the Company, with the requirement of a licence;
nor did it give the Company any specific functions in connexion
with the issue of licences, and although Elizabeth confirmed her
sister’s grant on 10 November 1559, she had already, in the course
of the ecclesiastical settlement earlier in the year, taken steps to
provide for the continuance of the old system, and specifically laid
it down that the administration of the Company was to be subordinate
thereto. The licensing authority rested ultimately upon the <i>Act of
Supremacy</i>, by which the power of ecclesiastical jurisdiction for
the ‘reformation, order, and correction’ of all ‘errors, heresies,
schisms, abuses, offences, contempts, and enormities’ was annexed to
the Crown, and the Crown was authorized to exercise its jurisdiction
through the agency of a commission appointed under letters patent.<a id="FNanchor_522" href="#Footnote_522" class="fnanchor">[522]</a>
This Act received the royal assent on 8 May 1559, together with
the <i>Act of Uniformity</i> which established the Book of Common
Prayer, and made it an offence ‘in any interludes, plays, songs,
rhymes, or by other open words’ to ‘declare or speak anything in the
derogation, depraving, or despising’ of that book.<a id="FNanchor_523" href="#Footnote_523" class="fnanchor">[523]</a> In the course
of June followed a body of <i>Injunctions</i>, intended as a code of
ecclesiastical discipline to be promulgated at a series of diocesan
visitations held by commissioners under the <i>Act of Supremacy</i>.
One of these <i>Injunctions</i> is directly concerned with the abuses
of printers of books.<a id="FNanchor_524" href="#Footnote_524" class="fnanchor">[524]</a> It begins by forbidding any book or paper
to be printed without an express written licence either from the Queen
herself or from six of the Privy Council, or after perusal from two
persons being either the Archbishop of Canterbury or York, the Bishop
of London, the Chancellor of Oxford or Cambridge, or the Bishop or
Archdeacon for the place of printing. One of the two must always be the
Ordinary, and the names of the licensers are to be ‘added in the end’
of every book. This seems sufficiently to cover the ground, but the
<i>Injunction</i> goes on to make a special reference to ‘pamphlets,
plays and ballads’, from which anything<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span> ‘heretical, seditious, or
unseemly for Christian ears’ ought to be excluded; and for these it
prescribes a licence from ‘such her majesty’s commissioners, or three
of them, as be appointed in the city of London to hear and determine
divers causes ecclesiastical’. These commissioners are also to punish
breaches of the <i>Injunction</i>, and to take and notify an order as
to the prohibition or permission of ‘all other books of matters of
religion or policy, or governance’. An exemption is granted for books
ordinarily used in universities or schools. The Master and Wardens of
the Stationers’ Company are ‘straitly’ commanded to be obedient to
the <i>Injunction</i>. The commission here referred to was not one of
those entrusted with the diocesan visitations, but a more permanent
body sitting in London itself, which came to be known as the High
Commission. The reference to it in the <i>Injunction</i> reads like
an afterthought, but as the principal members of this commission were
the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Bishop of London, there is not
so much inconsistency between the two forms of procedure laid down
as might at first sight appear. The High Commission was not in fact
yet in existence when the <i>Injunctions</i> were issued, but it was
constituted under a patent of 19 July 1559, and was renewed from time
to time by fresh patents throughout the reign.<a id="FNanchor_525" href="#Footnote_525" class="fnanchor">[525]</a> The original
members, other than the two prelates, were chiefly Privy Councillors,
Masters of Requests, and other lawyers. The size of the body was
considerably increased by later patents, and a number of divines were
added. The patent of 1559 conferred upon the commissioners a general
power to exercise the royal jurisdiction in matters ecclesiastical. It
does not repeat in terms the provisions for the ‘allowing’ of books
contained in the <i>Injunctions</i>, but merely recites that ‘divers
seditious books’ have been set forth, and empowers the commissioners to
inquire into them.</p>

<p>The <i>Injunctions</i> and the Commission must be taken as embodying
the official machinery for the licensing of books up to the time of
the well-known Star Chamber order of 1586, although the continued
anxiety of the government in the matter is shown by a series of
proclamations and orders which suggest that no absolutely effective
method of suppressing undesirable publications had as yet been
attained.<a id="FNanchor_526" href="#Footnote_526" class="fnanchor">[526]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span> Mr. Pollard, who regards the procedure contemplated by
the <i>Injunctions</i> as ‘impossible’, believes that in practice the
Stationers’ Company, in ordinary cases, itself acted as a licensing
authority.<a id="FNanchor_527" href="#Footnote_527" class="fnanchor">[527]</a> Certainly this is the testimony, as regards the
period 1576–86, of a note of Sir John Lambe, Dean of the Arches, in
1636, which is based wholly or in part upon information derived from
Felix Kingston, then Master of the Company.<a id="FNanchor_528" href="#Footnote_528" class="fnanchor">[528]</a> Kingston added the
detail that in the case of a divinity book of importance the opinion
of theological experts was taken. Mr. Pollard expresses a doubt
whether Lambe or Kingston had much evidence before them other than
the registers of the Company which are still extant, and to these we
are in a position to turn for confirmation or qualification of their
statements.<a id="FNanchor_529" href="#Footnote_529" class="fnanchor">[529]</a> Unfortunately, the ordinances or constitutions under
which the master and wardens acted from the time of the incorporation
have not been preserved, and any additions made to these by the Court
of Assistants before the Restoration have not been printed.<a id="FNanchor_530" href="#Footnote_530" class="fnanchor">[530]</a> We
have some revised ordinances of 1678–82, and these help us by recording
as of ‘ancient usage’ a practice of entering all publications, other
than those under letters patent, in ‘the register-book of this
company’.<a id="FNanchor_531" href="#Footnote_531" class="fnanchor">[531]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span> It is in fact this register, incorporated from 1557 to
1571 in the annual accounts of the wardens and kept from 1576 onwards
as a subsidiary book by the clerk, which furnishes our principal
material. During 1557–71 the entries for each year are collected
under a general heading, which takes various forms. In 1557–8 it is
‘The entrynge of all such copyes as be lycensed to be prynted by the
master and wardyns of the mystery of stacioners’; in 1558–9 simply
‘Lycense for pryntinge’; in 1559–60, for which year the entries are
mixed up with others, ‘Receptes for fynes, graunting of coppyes and
other thynges’; in 1560–1 ‘For takynge of fynes for coppyes’. This
formula lasts until 1565–6, when ‘The entrynge of coopyes’ takes its
place. The wording of the individual entries also varies during the
period, but generally it indicates the receipt of a money payment in
return for a license.<a id="FNanchor_532" href="#Footnote_532" class="fnanchor">[532]</a> In a very few cases, by no means always
of divinity books, the licence is said to be ‘by’, or the licence or
perhaps the book itself, to be ‘authorized’ or ‘allowed’ or ‘perused’
or ‘appointed’ by the Bishop of London; still more rarely by the
Archbishop of Canterbury or by both prelates; once by the Archbishops
of Canterbury and York; once by the Council.<a id="FNanchor_533" href="#Footnote_533" class="fnanchor">[533]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span></p>

<p>Richard Collins, on his appointment as Clerk of the Company in 1575,
records that one of his duties was to enter ‘lycences for pryntinge
of copies’ and one section of his register is accordingly devoted to
this purpose.<a id="FNanchor_534" href="#Footnote_534" class="fnanchor">[534]</a> It has no general heading, but the summary accounts
of the wardens up to 1596 continue to refer to the receipts as ‘for
licencinge of copies’.<a id="FNanchor_535" href="#Footnote_535" class="fnanchor">[535]</a> The character of the individual entries
between 1576 and 1586 is much as in the account books. The name of
a stationer is given in the margin and is followed by some such
formula as ‘Receyved of him for his licence to prynte’ or more briefly
‘Lycenced vnto him’, with the title of the book, any supplementary
information which the clerk thought relevant, and a note of the payment
made. Occasional alternatives are ‘Allowed’, ‘Admitted’, ‘Graunted’
or ‘Tolerated’ ‘vnto him’, of which the three first appear to have
been regarded as especially appropriate to transfers of existing
copyrights;<a id="FNanchor_536" href="#Footnote_536" class="fnanchor">[536]</a> and towards the end of the period appears the more
important variant ‘Allowed vnto him for his copie’.<a id="FNanchor_537" href="#Footnote_537" class="fnanchor">[537]</a> References
to external authorizers gradually become rather more frequent,
although they are still the exception and not the rule; the function
is fulfilled, not only by the bishop, the archbishop, or the Council,
but also upon occasion by the Lord Chancellor or the Secretary, by
individual Privy Councillors, by the Lord Mayor, the Recorder or the
Remembrancer of the City, and by certain masters and doctors, who
may be the ministers mentioned by Felix Kingston, and who probably
held regular deputations from a proper ecclesiastical authority as
‘correctors’ to the printers.<a id="FNanchor_538" href="#Footnote_538" class="fnanchor">[538]</a> It is certain that such a post was
held in 1571 by one Talbot, a servant of the Archbishop of Canterbury.
On the other hand the clerk, at first tentatively and then as a matter
of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span> regular practice, begins to record the part taken by the master and
wardens. The first example is a very explicit entry, in which the book
is said to be ‘licensed to be printed’ by the archbishop and ‘alowed’
by the master and a warden.<a id="FNanchor_539" href="#Footnote_539" class="fnanchor">[539]</a> But the formula which becomes normal
does not dwell on any differentiation of functions, and merely states
the licence as being ‘under the hands of’ the wardens or of one of
them or the master, or of these and of some one who may be presumed to
be an external corrector. To the precise significance of ‘under the
hands of’ I must return. Increased caution with regard to dangerous
books is also borne witness to during this period by the occasional
issue of a qualified licence. In 1580 Richard Jones has to sign his
name in the register to a promise ‘to bring the whole impression’ of
<i>The Labyrinth of Liberty</i> ‘into the Hall in case it be disliked
when it is printed’.<a id="FNanchor_540" href="#Footnote_540" class="fnanchor">[540]</a> In 1583 the same stationer undertakes ‘to
print of his own perill’.<a id="FNanchor_541" href="#Footnote_541" class="fnanchor">[541]</a> In 1584 it is a play which is thus
brought into question, Lyly’s <i>Sapho and Phao</i>, and Thomas Cadman
gets no more than ‘yt is graunted vnto him yat yf he gett ye commedie
of Sappho laufully alowed vnto him, then none of this cumpanie shall
interrupt him to enjoye yt’. Other entries direct that lawful authority
must be obtained before printing, and in one case there is a specific
reference to the royal <i>Injunctions</i>.<a id="FNanchor_542" href="#Footnote_542" class="fnanchor">[542]</a> Conditions of other
kinds are also sometimes found in entries; a book must be printed at
a particular press, or the licence is to be voided if it prove to be
another man’s copy.<a id="FNanchor_543" href="#Footnote_543" class="fnanchor">[543]</a> The caution of the Stationers may have been
motived by dissatisfaction on the part of the government which finally
took shape in the issue of the Star Chamber order of 23 June 1586.
This was a result of the firmer policy towards Puritan indiscipline
initiated by Whitgift and the new High Commission which he procured on
his succession to the primacy in 1583.<a id="FNanchor_544" href="#Footnote_544" class="fnanchor">[544]</a> It had two main<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span> objects.
One, with which we are not immediately concerned, was to limit the
number of printers and their presses; the other, to concentrate the
censorship of all ordinary books, including plays, in the hands of the
archbishop and the bishop. It is not clear whether the prelates were to
act in their ordinary capacity or as High Commissioners; anyhow they
had the authority of the High Commission, itself backed by the Privy
Council, behind them. The effect of the order is shown in a bustle
amongst the publishers to get on to the register a number of ballads
and other trifles which they had hitherto neglected to enter, and in a
considerable increase in the submissions of books for approval, either
to the prelates themselves, or to persons who are now clearly acting
as ecclesiastical deputies.<a id="FNanchor_545" href="#Footnote_545" class="fnanchor">[545]</a> On 30 June 1588 an official list of
deputies was issued by the archbishop, and amongst these were several
who had already authorized books before and after 1586. These deputies,
and other correctors whose names appear in the register at later
dates, are as a rule traceable as episcopal chaplains, prebendaries
of St. Paul’s, or holders of London benefices.<a id="FNanchor_546" href="#Footnote_546" class="fnanchor">[546]</a> Some of them
were themselves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span> members of the High Commission. Occasionally laymen
were appointed.<a id="FNanchor_547" href="#Footnote_547" class="fnanchor">[547]</a> The main work of correction now fell to these
officials, but books were still sometimes allowed by the archbishop or
bishop in person, or by the Privy Council or some member of that body.</p>

<p>The reaction of the changes of 1586–88 upon the entries in the register
is on the whole one of degree rather than of kind. Occasionally the
wording suggests a differentiation between the functions of the wardens
and those of the ecclesiastical licensers, but more often the clerk
contents himself with a mere record of what ‘hands’ each book was
under.<a id="FNanchor_548" href="#Footnote_548" class="fnanchor">[548]</a> Some shifting of the point of view is doubtless involved in
the fact that ‘Entered vnto him for his copie’ and ‘Allowed vnto him
for his copie’ now become the normal formulas, and by 1590–1 ‘Licenced
vnto him’ has disappeared altogether.<a id="FNanchor_549" href="#Footnote_549" class="fnanchor">[549]</a> But a great number of books,
including most ballads and pamphlets and some plays, are still entered
without note of any authority other than that of the wardens, and about
1593 the proportion of cases submitted to the ecclesiastical deputies
sensibly begins to slacken, although the continuance of conditional
entries shows that some caution was exercised. An intervention of the
prelates in 1599 reversed the tendency again.<a id="FNanchor_550" href="#Footnote_550" class="fnanchor">[550]</a> As regards plays
in particular,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span> the wardens received a sharp reminder, ‘that noe
playes be printed except they be allowed by suche as haue authority’;
and although they do not seem to have interpreted this as requiring
reference to a corrector in every case, conditional entries of plays
become for a time numerous.<a id="FNanchor_551" href="#Footnote_551" class="fnanchor">[551]</a> They stop altogether in 1607, when the
responsibility for play correction appears to have been taken over,
presumably under an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span> arrangement with the prelates, by the Master of
the Revels.<a id="FNanchor_552" href="#Footnote_552" class="fnanchor">[552]</a> Henceforward and to the end of Buck’s mastership,
nearly all play entries are under the hands not only of the wardens,
but of the Master or of a deputy acting on his behalf. Meanwhile, for
books other than plays, the ecclesiastical authority succeeded more
and more in establishing itself, although even up to the time of the
Commonwealth the wardens never altogether ceased to enter ballads and
such small deer on their own responsibility.</p>

<p>A little more may be gleaned from the ‘Fynes for breakinge of good
orders’, which like the book entries were recorded by the wardens in
their annual accounts up to 1571 and by the clerk in his register
from 1576 to 1605.<a id="FNanchor_553" href="#Footnote_553" class="fnanchor">[553]</a> But many of these were for irregularities in
apprenticeship and the like, and where a particular book was concerned,
the book is more often named than the precise offence committed in
relation to it. The fine is for printing ‘contrary to the orders of
this howse’, ‘contrary to our ordenaunces’, or merely ‘disorderly’.
Trade defects, such as ‘stechyng’ of books, are sometimes in question,
and sometimes the infringement of other men’s copies.<a id="FNanchor_554" href="#Footnote_554" class="fnanchor">[554]</a> But the
character of the books concerned suggests that some at least of the
fines for printing ‘without lycense’, ‘without aucthoritie’, ‘without
alowance’, ‘without entrance’, ‘before the wardyns handes were to yt’
were due to breaches of the regulations for censorship, and in a few
instances the information is specific.<a id="FNanchor_555" href="#Footnote_555" class="fnanchor">[555]</a> The book is a ‘lewde’ book,
or ‘not tolerable’, or has already been condemned to be burnt, or the
printing is contrary to ‘her maiesties prohibicon’ or ‘the decrees
of the star chamber’.<a id="FNanchor_556" href="#Footnote_556" class="fnanchor">[556]</a> More rarely a fine was accompanied by the
sequestration of the offending books, or the breaking up of a press,
or even imprisonment. In these cases the company may have been acting
under stimulus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span> from higher powers; in dealing with a culprit in 1579,
they direct that ‘for his offence, so farre as it toucheth ye same
house only, he shall paye a fine’.<a id="FNanchor_557" href="#Footnote_557" class="fnanchor">[557]</a></p>

<p>Putting together the entries and the fines, we can arrive at an
approximate notion of the position occupied by the Stationers’ Company
as an intermediary between the individual stationers and the higher
powers in Church and State. That it is only approximate and that many
points of detail remain obscure is largely due to the methods of the
clerk. Richard Collins did not realize the importance, at least to the
future historian, of set diplomatic formulas, and it is by no means
clear to what extent the variations in the phrasing of his record
correspond to variations in the facts recorded. But it is my impression
that he was in substance a careful registrar, especially as regards the
authority under which his entries were made, and that if he did not
note the presence in any case of a corrector’s ‘hand’ to a book, it is
fair evidence that such a hand was not before him. On this assumption
the register confirms the inference to be drawn from the statements
of Lambe and Kingston in 1636, that before 1586 the provision of the
<i>Injunctions</i> for licensing by the High Commission for London
was not ordinarily operative, and that as a rule the only actual
licences issued were those of the Stationers’ Company, who used their
own discretion in submitting books about which they felt doubtful to
the bishop or the archbishop or to an authorized corrector.<a id="FNanchor_558" href="#Footnote_558" class="fnanchor">[558]</a> That
books licensed by the Company without such reference were regarded as
having been technically licensed under the <i>Injunctions</i>, one
would hesitate to say. Licence is a fairly general term, and as used
in the Stationers’ Register it does not necessarily cover anything
more than a permit required by the internal ordinances of the Company
itself. Certainly its officials claimed to issue licences to its
members for other purposes than printing.<a id="FNanchor_559" href="#Footnote_559" class="fnanchor">[559]</a> What Lambe and Kingston
do not tell us, and perhaps ought to have told us, is that, when the
master and wardens did call in the assistance of expert referees, it
was not to ‘ministers’ merely chosen by themselves that they applied,
but to official correctors nominated by the High Commission, or by the
archbishop or bishop on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span> its behalf. Nor must it be supposed that no
supervision of the proceedings of the company was exercised by the High
Commission itself. We find that body writing to the Company to uphold
a patent in 1560.<a id="FNanchor_560" href="#Footnote_560" class="fnanchor">[560]</a> It was upon its motion in 1566 that the Privy
Council made a Star Chamber order calling attention to irregularities
which had taken place, and directing the master and wardens to search
for the offenders.<a id="FNanchor_561" href="#Footnote_561" class="fnanchor">[561]</a> And its authority, concurrent with that of the
Privy Council itself, to license books, is confirmed by a letter of
the Council to the company in 1570.<a id="FNanchor_562" href="#Footnote_562" class="fnanchor">[562]</a> So much for the period before
1586. Another thing which Lambe and Kingston do not tell us, and which
the register, if it can be trusted, does, is that the effective change
introduced by the Star Chamber of that year was only one of degree and
not of kind. It is true that an increasing number of books came, after
one set-back, to be submitted to correctors; that the clerk begins to
lay emphasis in his wording upon entrance rather than upon licence;
that there are some hints that the direct responsibility of the wardens
was for a kind of ‘allowance’ distinct from and supplementary to that
of censorship. But it does not appear to be true that, then or at any
later time, they wholly refused to enter any book except after taking
cognizance of an authority beyond their own.</p>

<p>In fact the register, from the very beginning, was not purely, or
perhaps even primarily, one of allowances. It had two other functions,
even more important from the point of view of the internal economy
of the Company. It was a fee-book, subsidiary to the annual accounts
of the wardens, and showing the details of sums which they had to
return in those accounts.<a id="FNanchor_563" href="#Footnote_563" class="fnanchor">[563]</a> And it was a register of copyrights.
A stationer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span> brought his copy to the wardens and paid his fee, in
order that he might be protected by an official acknowledgement of his
interest in the book against any infringement by a trade competitor. No
doubt the wardens would not, and under the ordinances of the company
might not, give this acknowledgement, unless they were satisfied that
the book was one which might lawfully be printed. But copyright was
what the stationer wanted, for after all most books were not dangerous
in the eyes even of an Elizabethan censorship, whereas there would be
little profit in publishing, if any rival were at liberty to cut in
and reprint for himself the result of a successful speculation. It is
a clear proof of this that the entrances include, not only new books,
but also those in which rights had been transferred from one stationer
to another.<a id="FNanchor_564" href="#Footnote_564" class="fnanchor">[564]</a> Obviously no new allowance by a corrector would be
required in such cases. And as regards copyright and licence alike,
the entry in the register, although convenient to all concerned, was
in itself no more than registration, the formal putting upon record
of action already taken upon responsible authority. This authority
did not rest with the clerk. In a few cases, indeed, he does seem to
have entered an unimportant book at his own discretion.<a id="FNanchor_565" href="#Footnote_565" class="fnanchor">[565]</a> But his
functions were really subordinate to those of the wardens, as is shown
by his practice from about 1580, of regularly citing the ‘hands’ or
signed directions of those officers, as well as of the correctors, upon
which he was acting. These ‘hands’ are not in the register, and there
is sufficient evidence that they were ordinarily endorsed upon the
manuscript or a printed copy of the book itself.<a id="FNanchor_566" href="#Footnote_566" class="fnanchor">[566]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span> Exceptionally
there might be an oral direction, or a separate letter or warrant of
approval, which was probably preserved in a cupboard at the company’s
hall.<a id="FNanchor_567" href="#Footnote_567" class="fnanchor">[567]</a> Here too were kept copies of prints, although not, I
think, the endorsed copies, which seem to have remained with the
stationers.<a id="FNanchor_568" href="#Footnote_568" class="fnanchor">[568]</a> I take it that the procedure was somewhat as follows.
The stationer would bring his book to a warden together with the fee or
some plausible excuse for deferring payment to a later date. The warden
had to consider the questions both of property and of licence. Possibly
the title of each book was published in the hall, in order that any
other stationer who thought that he had an interest in it might make
his claim.<a id="FNanchor_569" href="#Footnote_569" class="fnanchor">[569]</a> Cases of disputed interest would go for determination
to the Court of Assistants, who with the master and wardens for the
year formed the ultimate governing body of the company, and had
power in the last resort to revoke an authority to print already
granted.<a id="FNanchor_570" href="#Footnote_570" class="fnanchor">[570]</a> But if no difficulty as to ownership arose,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span> and if the
book was already endorsed as allowable by a corrector, the warden would
add his own endorsement, and it was then open to the stationer to take
the book to the clerk, show the ‘hands’, pay the fee if it was still
outstanding, and get the formalities completed by registration.<a id="FNanchor_571" href="#Footnote_571" class="fnanchor">[571]</a>
If, however, the warden found no endorsement by a corrector on the
copy, then there were three courses open to him. He might take the
risk of passing an obviously harmless book on his own responsibility.
He might refuse his ‘hand’ until the stationer had got that of the
corrector. Or he might make a qualified endorsement, which the clerk
would note in the register, sanctioning publication so far as copyright
was concerned, but only upon condition that proper authority should
first be obtained. The dates on the title-pages of plays, when compared
with those of the entries, suggest that, as would indeed be natural,
the procedure was completed before publication; not necessarily before
printing, as the endorsements were sometimes on printed copies.<a id="FNanchor_572" href="#Footnote_572" class="fnanchor">[572]</a>
Several cases of re-entry after a considerable interval may indicate
that copyright lapsed unless it was exercised within a reasonable time.
As a rule, a play appeared within a year or so after it was entered,
and was either printed or published by the stationer who had entered
it, or by some other to whom he is known, or may plausibly be supposed,
to have transferred his interest. Where a considerable interval exists
between the date of an entry and that of the first known print, it is
sometimes possible that an earlier print has been lost.<a id="FNanchor_573" href="#Footnote_573" class="fnanchor">[573]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span></p>

<p>I do not think that it can be assumed that the absence of an entry in
the register is evidence that the book was not duly licensed, so far
as the ecclesiastical authorities were concerned. If its status was
subsequently questioned, the signed copy could itself be produced.
Certainly, when a conditional entry had been made, requiring better
authority to be obtained, the fulfilment of the condition was by
no means always, although it was sometimes, recorded. Possibly the
‘better authority’ was shown to the warden rather than the clerk.
On the other hand, it is certain that, under the ordinances of the
Company, publication without entrance exposed the stationer to a
fine, and it is therefore probable that entrance was also necessary
to secure copyright.<a id="FNanchor_574" href="#Footnote_574" class="fnanchor">[574]</a> Sometimes the omission was repaired on the
occasion of a subsequent transfer of interest. So far as plays are
concerned, there seems to have been greater laxity in this respect
as time went on. Before 1586, or at any rate before 1584, there are
hardly any unentered plays, if we make the reasonable assumption
that certain prints of 1573 and 1575 appeared in the missing lists
for 1571–5.<a id="FNanchor_575" href="#Footnote_575" class="fnanchor">[575]</a> Between 1584 and 1615 the number is considerable,
being over fifty, or nearly a quarter of the total number of plays
printed during that period. An examination of individual cases does
not disclose any obvious reason why some plays should be entered and
others not. The unentered plays are spread over the whole period
concerned. They come from the repertories of nearly all the theatres.
They include ‘surreptitious’ plays, which may be supposed to have been
printed without the consent of the authors or owners, but they also
include plays to which prefaces by authors or owners are prefixed. They
were issued by publishers of good standing as well as by others less
reputable; and as a rule their publishers appear to have been entering
or not entering, quite indifferently, at about the same<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span> date. To this
generalization I find an exception, in Thomas Archer, who printed
six plays without entry between 1607 and 1613 and entered none.<a id="FNanchor_576" href="#Footnote_576" class="fnanchor">[576]</a>
The large number of unentered plays is rather a puzzle, and I do not
know the solution. In some cases, as we shall see, the publishers
may have preferred not to court publicity for their enterprises by
bringing them before the wardens. In others they may merely have been
unbusinesslike, or may have thought that the chances of profit hardly
justified the expenditure of sixpence on acquiring copyright. Yet many
of the unentered plays went through more than one edition, including
<i>Mucedorus</i>, a book of enduring popularity, and they do not appear
to have been particularly subject to invasion by rival publishers. I
will leave it to Mr. Pollard.</p>

<p>These being the conditions, let us consider what number and what kinds
of plays got into print. It will be convenient to deal separately with
the two periods 1557–85 and 1586–1616. The operations of the Company
under their charter had hardly begun before Mary died. The Elizabethan
printing of plays opens in 1559 and for the first five years is of a
retrospective character. Half a dozen publishers, led by John King, who
died about 1561, and Thomas Colwell, who started business in the same
year, issued or entered seventeen plays. Of these one is not extant.
One is a ‘May-game’, perhaps contemporary. Five are translations;
four are Marian farces of the school of Udall, one a <i>débat</i> by
John Heywood, and five Protestant interludes of the reigns of Henry
and Edward, roughly edited in some cases so as to adapt them to
performance under the new queen.<a id="FNanchor_577" href="#Footnote_577" class="fnanchor">[577]</a> One more example of earlier Tudor
drama, <i>Ralph Roister Doister</i>, in addition to mere reprints,
appeared after 1565.<a id="FNanchor_578" href="#Footnote_578" class="fnanchor">[578]</a> And with that year, after a short lull of
activity, begins the genuine Elizabethan harvest, which by 1585 had
yielded forty-two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span> plays, of which thirty-nine are extant, although
two only in the form of fragments. On analysis, the greater number
of these, seventeen in all, fall into a group of moral interludes,
often controversial in tone, and in some cases approximating, through
the intermingling of concrete with abstract personages, on the one
hand to classical comedy, on the other to the mediaeval miracle-play.
There are also twelve translations or adaptations, including two from
Italian comedy. There is one neo-classical tragedy. And there are
nine plays which can best be classified as histories, of which seven
have a classical and two a romantic colouring.<a id="FNanchor_579" href="#Footnote_579" class="fnanchor">[579]</a> It is of interest
to compare this output of the printing-press with the chronicle of
Court performances over the same years which is recorded in the Revels
Accounts.<a id="FNanchor_580" href="#Footnote_580" class="fnanchor">[580]</a> Here we get, so far of course as can be judged from
a bare enumeration of titles, fourteen morals, twenty-one classical
histories, mainly shown by boys, twenty-two romantic histories, mainly
shown by men, and perhaps three farces, two plays of contemporary
realism, with one ‘antick’ play and two groups of short dramatic
episodes. It is clear that the main types are the same in both lists.
But only one of the printed plays, <i>Orestes</i>, actually appears in
the Court records, although <i>Damon and Pythias</i>, <i>Gorboduc</i>,
<i>Sapho and Phao</i>, <i>Campaspe</i>, and <i>The Arraignment of
Paris</i> were also given at Court, and the Revels Accounts after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
all only cover comparatively few years out of the whole period.<a id="FNanchor_581" href="#Footnote_581" class="fnanchor">[581]</a>
And there is a great discrepancy in the proportions in which the
various types are represented. The morals, which were obsolescent at
Court, are far more numerous in print than the classical and romantic
histories, which were already in enjoyment of their full vogue upon
the boards. My definite impression is that these early printed morals,
unlike the prints of later date, were in the main not drawn from the
actual repertories of companies, but were literary products, written
with a didactic purpose, and printed in the hope that they would be
bought both by readers and by schoolmasters in search of suitable
pieces for performance by their pupils. They belong, like some similar
interludes, both original and translated, of earlier date, rather
to the tradition of the humanist academic drama, than to that of
the professional, or even quasi-professional, stage. There are many
things about the prints which, although not individually decisive,
tend when taken in bulk to confirm this theory. They are ‘compiled’,
according to their title-pages; sometimes the author is declared a
‘minister’ or a ‘learned clerke’.<a id="FNanchor_582" href="#Footnote_582" class="fnanchor">[582]</a> Nothing is, as a rule, said
to indicate that they have been acted.<a id="FNanchor_583" href="#Footnote_583" class="fnanchor">[583]</a> They are advertised, not
only as ‘new’, ‘merry’, ‘pretty’, ‘pleasant’, ‘delectable’, ‘witty’,
‘full of mirth and pastime’, but also as ‘excellent’, ‘worthy’,
‘godly’, ‘pithy’, ‘moral’, ‘pityfull’, ‘learned’, and ‘fruitfull’,
and occasionally the precise didactic intention is more elaborately
expounded either on the title-page or in a prologue.<a id="FNanchor_584" href="#Footnote_584" class="fnanchor">[584]</a> They are
furnished with analyses showing the number of actors necessary to take
all the parts, and in one case there is a significant note that the
arrangement is ‘most convenient for such as be disposed, either to
shew this comedie in priuate houses, or otherwise’.<a id="FNanchor_585" href="#Footnote_585" class="fnanchor">[585]</a> They often
conclude with a generalized<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span> prayer for the Queen and the estates of
the realm, which omits any special petition for the individual lord
such as we have reason to believe the protected players used.<a id="FNanchor_586" href="#Footnote_586" class="fnanchor">[586]</a>
The texts are much better than the later texts based upon acting
copies. The stage-directions read like the work of authors rather
than of book-keepers, notably in the use of ‘out’ rather than of ‘in’
to indicate exits, and in the occasional insertion both of hints for
‘business’ and of explanatory comments aimed at a reader rather than
an actor.<a id="FNanchor_587" href="#Footnote_587" class="fnanchor">[587]</a> It should be added that this type of play begins to
disappear at the point when the growing Calvinist spirit led to a sharp
breach between the ministry and the stage, and discredited even moral
play-writing amongst divines. The latest morals, of which there are
some even during the second period of play-publication, have much more
the look of rather antiquated survivals from working repertories.<a id="FNanchor_588" href="#Footnote_588" class="fnanchor">[588]</a>
The ‘May-game’ of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span> <i>Robin Hood</i> seems to me to be of a literary
origin similar to that of the contemporary ‘morals’.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the period a new element is introduced with Lyly and
Peele, who, like Edwardes before them, were not divines but secular
scholars, and presumably desired a permanent life for their literary
achievements. The publication of Lyly’s plays for Paul’s carries us on
into the period 1586–1616, and the vaunting of their performance before
the Queen is soon followed by that of other plays, beginning with
<i>The Troublesome Reign of John</i>, as publicly acted in the City of
London. During 1586–1616 two hundred and thirty-seven plays in all were
published or at least entered on the Stationers’ Register, in addition
to thirteen printed elsewhere than in London. Of many of these, and
of some of those earlier published, there were one or more reprints.
It is not until the last year of the period that the first example of
a collective edition of the plays of any author makes its appearance.
This is <i>The Workes of Benjamin Jonson</i>, which is moreover in
folio, whereas the prints of individual plays were almost invariably
in quarto.<a id="FNanchor_589" href="#Footnote_589" class="fnanchor">[589]</a> A second volume of Jonson’s <i>Works</i> was begun in
1631 and completed in 1640. Shakespeare’s plays had to wait until 1623
for collective treatment, Lyly’s until 1632, Marston’s until 1633,
and Beaumont and Fletcher’s until 1647 and 1679, although a partial
collection of Shakespearian plays in quarto has been shown to have
been contemplated and abandoned in 1619.<a id="FNanchor_590" href="#Footnote_590" class="fnanchor">[590]</a> Of the two hundred and
thirty-seven plays proposed for publication two hundred and fourteen
are extant. Twenty-three are only known by entries in the Stationers’
Register, and as plays were not always entered, it is conceivable that
one or two may have been published, and have passed into oblivion. Of
the two hundred and fourteen extant plays, six are translations from
the Latin, Italian, or French, and seven may reasonably be suspected of
being merely closet plays, intended for the eye of the reader alone.
The other two hundred and one may be taken to have undergone the
test<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span> of actual performance. Six were given by amateurs, at Court or
elsewhere, and eleven, of which three are Latin and eight English, are
University plays. So far as the professional companies are concerned,
the repertories which have probably been best preserved, owing to
the fact that the poets were in a position to influence publication,
are those of the boys. We have thirty-one plays which, certainly or
probably, came to the press from the Chapel and Queen’s Revels boys,
twenty-five from the Paul’s boys, and eight from the King’s Revels
boys. To the Queen’s men we may assign eleven plays, to Sussex’s three,
to Pembroke’s five, to Derby’s four, to Oxford’s one, to Strange’s or
the Admiral’s and Henry’s thirty-two, to the Chamberlain’s and King’s
thirty-four, to Worcester’s and Anne’s sixteen, to Charles’s one.
Some of these had at earlier dates been played by other companies.
Fifteen plays remain, not a very large proportion, which cannot be
safely assigned.<a id="FNanchor_591" href="#Footnote_591" class="fnanchor">[591]</a> There are twenty-seven manuscript English plays
or fragments of plays or plots of plays, and twenty-one Latin ones,
mostly of a university type, which also belong to the period 1586–1616.
There are fifty-one plays which were certainly or probably produced
before 1616, but were not printed until later, many of them in the
Shakespeare and Beaumont and Fletcher folios. And there are some
twenty-two others, which exist in late prints, but may be wholly, or
more often partially, of early workmanship. The resultant total of
three hundred and seven is considerable, but there is reason to suppose
that it only represents a comparatively small fraction of the complete
crop of these thirty pullulating dramatic years. Of over two hundred
and eighty plays recorded by Henslowe as produced or commissioned by
the companies for whom he acted as banker between 1592 and 1603, we
have only some forty and perhaps revised versions of a few others.<a id="FNanchor_592" href="#Footnote_592" class="fnanchor">[592]</a>
Thomas Heywood claimed in 1633 to have had ‘an entire hand, or at least
a maine finger’, in not less than two hundred and twenty plays, and
of these we can only identify or even guess at about two score, of
which several are certainly lost. That any substantial number of plays
got printed, but have failed to reach us, is improbable. From time
to time an unknown print, generally of early date, turns up in some
bibliographical backwater, but of the seventy-five titles which I have
brought together under the head of ‘Lost Plays’ some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span> probably rest
upon misunderstandings and others represent works which were not plays
at all, while a large proportion are derived from late entries in the
Stationers’ Register by Humphrey Moseley of plays which he may have
possessed in manuscript but never actually proceeded to publish.<a id="FNanchor_593" href="#Footnote_593" class="fnanchor">[593]</a>
Some of the earlier unfulfilled entries may be of similar type. An
interesting piece of evidence pointing to the practically complete
survival at any rate of seventeenth-century prints is afforded in a
catalogue of his library of plays made by Sir John Harington in or
about 1610.<a id="FNanchor_594" href="#Footnote_594" class="fnanchor">[594]</a> Harington possessed 129 distinct plays, as well as
a number of duplicates. Only 9 of these were printed before 1586. He
had 14 out of 38 printed during 1588–94, and 15 out of 25 printed
during 1595–99. His absence in Ireland during 1599 probably led him
to miss several belonging to that year, and his most vigorous period
as a collector began with 1600. During 1600–10 he secured 90 out of
105; that is to say exactly six-sevenths of the complete output of
the London press. I neglect plays printed outside London in these
figures. There is only one play among the 129 which is not known to us.
Apparently it bore the title <i>Belinus and Brennus</i>.</p>

<p>It is generally supposed, and I think with justice, that the acting
companies did not find it altogether to their advantage to have their
plays printed. Heywood, indeed, in the epistle to his <i>English
Traveller</i> (1633) tells us that this was sometimes the case.<a id="FNanchor_595" href="#Footnote_595" class="fnanchor">[595]</a>
Presumably the danger was not so much that readers would not become
spectators, as that other companies might buy the plays and act them;
and of this practice there are some dubious instances, although at any
rate by Caroline times it had been brought under control by the Lord
Chamberlain.<a id="FNanchor_596" href="#Footnote_596" class="fnanchor">[596]</a> At any rate, we find the Admiral’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span> in 1600 borrowing
40<i>s.</i> ‘to geue vnto the printer, to staye the printing of Patient
Gresell’.<a id="FNanchor_597" href="#Footnote_597" class="fnanchor">[597]</a> We find the King’s Revels syndicate in 1608 entering
into a formal agreement debarring its members from putting any of the
play-books jointly owned by them into print. And we find the editor and
publisher of <i>Troilus and Cressida</i>, although that had in fact
never been played, bidding his readers in 1609 ‘thanke fortune for the
scape it hath made amongst you; since by the grand possessors wills I
beleeue you should have prayd for them rather than beene prayd’. The
marked fluctuation in the output of plays in different years is capable
of explanation on the theory that, so long as the companies were
prosperous, they kept a tight hold on their ‘books’, and only let them
pass into the hands of the publishers when adversity broke them up, or
when they had some special need to raise funds. The periods of maximum
output are 1594, 1600, and 1607. In 1594 the companies were reforming
themselves after a long and disastrous spell of plague; and in
particular the Queen’s, Pembroke’s, and Sussex’s men were all ruined,
and their books were thrown in bulk upon the market.<a id="FNanchor_598" href="#Footnote_598" class="fnanchor">[598]</a> It has been
suggested that the sales of 1600 may have been due to Privy Council
restrictions of that year, which limited the number of companies, and
forbade them to play for more than two days in the week.<a id="FNanchor_599" href="#Footnote_599" class="fnanchor">[599]</a> But it is
very doubtful whether the limitation of days really became operative,
and many of the plays published belonged to the two companies, the
Chamberlain’s and the Admiral’s, who stood to gain by the elimination
of competitors. An alternative reason might be found in the call for
ready money involved by the building of the Globe in 1599 and the
Fortune in 1600. The main factor in 1607 was the closing of Paul’s and
the sale of the plays acted there.</p>

<p>Sometimes the companies were outwitted. Needy and unscrupulous
stationers might use illegitimate means to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span> acquire texts for which
they had not paid as a basis for ‘surreptitious’ or ‘piratical’
prints.<a id="FNanchor_600" href="#Footnote_600" class="fnanchor">[600]</a> A hired actor might be bribed to disclose his ‘part’
and so much as he could remember of the ‘parts’ of others. Dr. Greg
has made it seem probable that the player of the Host was an agent
in furnishing the text of the <i>Merry Wives</i>.<a id="FNanchor_601" href="#Footnote_601" class="fnanchor">[601]</a> A player of
Voltimand and other minor parts may have been similarly guilty as
regards <i>Hamlet</i>.<a id="FNanchor_602" href="#Footnote_602" class="fnanchor">[602]</a> Long before, the printer of <i>Gorboduc</i>
had succeeded in ‘getting a copie thereof at some yongmans hand that
lacked a little money and much discretion’. Or the poet himself might
be to blame. Thomas Heywood takes credit in the epistle to <i>The Rape
of Lucrece</i> that it had not been his custom ‘to commit my playes to
the presse’, like others who ‘have vsed a double sale of their labours,
first to the stage, and after to the presse’. Yet this had not saved
his plays from piracy, for some of them had been ‘copied only by the
eare’ and issued in a corrupt and mangled form. A quarter of a century
later, in writing a prologue for a revival of his <i>If You Know not
Me, You Know Nobody</i>, he tells us that this was one of the corrupt
issues, and adds that</p>

<p class="p-left">Modern critics have sought in shorthand the source of
other ‘bad’ and probably surreptitious texts of plays, and one has gone
so far as to trace in them the peculiarities of a particular system
expounded in the <i>Characterie</i> (1588) of Timothy Bright.<a id="FNanchor_603" href="#Footnote_603" class="fnanchor">[603]</a> The
whole question of surreptitious prints has naturally been explored most
closely in connexion with the textual criticism of Shakespeare, and
the latest investigator, Mr. Pollard, has come to the conclusion that,
in spite of the general condemnation of the Folio editors, the only
Shakespearian Quartos which can reasonably be labelled as surreptitious
or as textually ‘bad’ are the First Quartos of <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>,
<i>Henry V</i>, <i>Merry Wives of Windsor</i>, <i>Hamlet</i>, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
<i>Pericles</i>, although he strongly suspects that there once existed
a similar edition of <i>Love’s Labour’s Lost</i>.<a id="FNanchor_604" href="#Footnote_604" class="fnanchor">[604]</a> I have no ground
for dissenting from this judgement.</p>

<p>The question whether the actors, in protecting their property
from the pirates, could look for any assistance from the official
controllers of the press is one of some difficulty. We may perhaps
infer, with the help of the conditional entries of <i>The Blind Beggar
of Alexandria</i> and <i>The Spanish Tragedy</i>, and the special
order made in the case of <i>Dr. Faustus</i>, that before assigning
a ‘copy’ to one stationer the wardens of the Company took some steps
to ascertain whether any other stationer laid a claim to it. It does
not follow that they also inquired whether the applicant had come
honestly or dishonestly by his manuscript.<a id="FNanchor_605" href="#Footnote_605" class="fnanchor">[605]</a> Mr. Pollard seems
inclined to think that, although they were under no formal obligation
to intervene, they would not be likely, as men of common sense, to
encourage dishonesty.<a id="FNanchor_606" href="#Footnote_606" class="fnanchor">[606]</a> If this argument stood alone, I should
not have much confidence in it. There is a Publishers’ Association
to-day, doubtless composed of men of common sense, but it is not a
body to which one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span> would naturally commit interests which might come
into conflict with those of members of the trade. It would be another
matter, however, if the actors were in a position to bring outside
interest to bear against the pirates, through the licensers, or
through the Privy Council on whom ultimately the licensers depended.
And this in fact seems to have been the way in which a solution of
the problem was gradually arrived at. Apart altogether from plays,
there are instances upon record in which individuals, who were in a
position to command influence, successfully adopted a similar method.
We find Fulke Greville in 1586 writing to Sir Francis Walsingham,
on the information of the stationer Ponsonby, to warn him that the
publication of the <i>Arcadia</i> was being planned, and to advise him
to get ‘made stay of that mercenary book’ by means of an application
to the Archbishop or to Dr. Cosin, ‘who have, as he says, a copy
to peruse to that end’.<a id="FNanchor_607" href="#Footnote_607" class="fnanchor">[607]</a> Similarly we find Francis Bacon, in
the preface to his <i>Essayes</i> of 1597, excusing himself for
the publication on the ground that surreptitious adventurers were
at work, and ‘to labour the staie of them had bin troublesome and
subiect to interpretation’. Evidently he had come to a compromise,
of which the Stationers’ Register retains traces in the cancellation
by a court of an entry of the <i>Essayes</i> to Richard Serger, and
a re-entry to H. Hooper, the actual publisher, ‘under the handes of
Master Francis Bacon, Master Doctor Stanhope, Master Barlowe, and
Master Warden Lawson’.<a id="FNanchor_608" href="#Footnote_608" class="fnanchor">[608]</a> The actors, too, were not wholly without
influence. They had their patrons and protectors, the Lord Chamberlain
and the Lord Admiral, in the Privy Council, and although, as Mr.
Pollard points out, it certainly would not have been good business
to worry an important minister about every single forty-shilling
piracy, it may have been worth while to seek a standing protection,
analogous to the old-fashioned ‘privilege’, against a series of such
annoyances. At any rate, this is what, while the Admiral’s contented
themselves with buying off the printer of <i>Patient Grissell</i>, the
Chamberlain’s apparently attempted, although at first with indifferent
success, to secure. In 1597 John Danter, a stationer of the worst
reputation, had printed a surreptitious and ‘bad’ edition of <i>Romeo
and Juliet</i>, and possibly, if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span> Mr. Pollard’s conjecture is right,
another of <i>Love’s Labour’s Lost</i>. He had made no entry in the
Register, and it was therefore open to another publisher, Cuthbert
Burby, to issue, without breach of copyright, ‘corrected’ editions of
the same plays.<a id="FNanchor_609" href="#Footnote_609" class="fnanchor">[609]</a> This he did, with suitable trumpetings of the
corrections on the title-pages, and presumably by arrangement with the
Chamberlain’s men. It was this affair which must, I think, have led
the company to apply for protection to their lord. On 22 July 1598
an entry was made in the Stationers’ Register of <i>The Merchant of
Venice</i> for the printer James Roberts. This entry is conditional
in form, but it differs from the normal conditional entries in that
the requirement specified is not an indefinite ‘aucthoritie’ but a
‘lycence from the Right honorable the lord chamberlen’. Roberts also
entered <i>Cloth Breeches and Velvet Hose</i> on 27 May 1600, <i>A
Larum for London</i> on 29 May 1600, and <i>Troilus and Cressida</i> on
7 February 1603. These also are all conditional entries but of a normal
type. No condition, however, is attached to his entry of <i>Hamlet</i>
on 26 July 1602. Now comes a significant piece of evidence, which at
least shows that in 1600, as well as in 1598, the Stationers’ Company
were paying particular attention to entries of plays coming from the
repertory of the Chamberlain’s men. The register contains, besides the
formal entries, certain spare pages upon which the clerk was accustomed
to make occasional memoranda, and amongst these memoranda we find the
following:<a id="FNanchor_610" href="#Footnote_610" class="fnanchor">[610]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span></p>

<p>There are possibly two notes here, but we may reasonably date them both
in 1600, as <i>Every Man In his Humour</i> was entered to Cuthbert
Burby and Walter Burre on 14 August 1600 and <i>Much Ado about
Nothing</i> to Andrew Wise and William Aspley on 23 August 1600, and
these plays appeared in 1601 and 1600 respectively. <i>Henry V</i>
was published, without entry and in a ‘bad’ text by Thomas Millington
and John Busby, also in 1600, while <i>As You Like It</i> remained
unprinted until 1623. Many attempts have been made to explain the story
of 4 August. Mr. Fleay conjectured that it was due to difficulties of
censorship; Mr. Furness that it was directed against James Roberts,
whom he regarded on the strength of the conditional entries as a man
of ‘shifty character’.<a id="FNanchor_611" href="#Footnote_611" class="fnanchor">[611]</a> But there is no reason to read Roberts’s
name into the August memorandum at all; and I agree with Mr. Pollard
that the evidence of dishonesty against him has been exaggerated, and
that the privilege which he held for printing all play-bills for actors
makes it prima facie unlikely that his relations with the companies
would be irregular.<a id="FNanchor_612" href="#Footnote_612" class="fnanchor">[612]</a> On the other hand, I hesitate to accept Mr.
Pollard’s counter-theory that the four conditional Roberts entries were
of the nature of a deliberate plan ‘in the interest of the players in
order to postpone their publication till it could not injure the run
of the play and to make the task of the pirates more difficult’. One
would of course suppose that any entry, conditional or not, might serve
such a purpose, if the entering stationer was in league with the actors
and deliberately reserved publication. This is presumably what the
Admiral’s men paid Cuthbert Burby to do for <i>Patient Grissell</i>.
Mr. Pollard applies the same theory to Edward Blount’s unconditional
entries of <i>Pericles</i> and <i>Antony and Cleopatra</i> in 1608, and
it would certainly explain the delays in the publication of <i>Troilus
and Cressida</i> from 1603 to 1609 and of <i>Antony and Cleopatra</i>
from 1608 to 1623, and the absence of any edition of <i>Cloth Breeches
and Velvet Hose</i>. But it does not explain why <i>Hamlet</i>, entered
by Roberts in 1602, was issued by others in the ‘bad’ text of 1603,
or why <i>Pericles</i> was issued by Henry Gosson in the ‘bad’ text
of 1609.<a id="FNanchor_613" href="#Footnote_613" class="fnanchor">[613]</a> Mr. Pollard’s interpretation of the facts appears to
be influenced by the conditional character of four out of Roberts’s
five entries<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span> during 1598–1603, and I understand him to believe that
the ‘further aucthoritie’ required for <i>Cloth Breeches and Velvet
Hose</i> and <i>A Larum for London</i> and the ‘sufficient aucthoritie’
required for <i>Troilus and Cressida</i> were of the same nature as
the licence from the Lord Chamberlain specifically required for <i>The
Merchant of Venice</i>.<a id="FNanchor_614" href="#Footnote_614" class="fnanchor">[614]</a> It is not inconceivable that this may have
been so, but one is bound to take the Roberts conditional entries side
by side with the eight similar entries made between 1601 and 1606 for
other men, and in three at least of these (<i>The Dutch Courtesan</i>,
<i>Sir Giles Goosecap</i>, <i>The Fleir</i>) it is obvious that the
authority demanded was that of the official correctors. Of course, the
correctors may themselves have had a hint from the Lord Chamberlain
to keep an eye upon the interests of his servants, but if the eleven
conditionally entered plays of 1600–6 be looked at as a group, it will
be seen that they are all plays of either a political or a satirical
character, which might well therefore call for particular attention
from the correctors in the discharge of their ordinary functions. I
have already suggested that the normal conditional entries represent
cases in which the wardens of the Stationers’ Company, while not
prepared to license a book on their own responsibility, short-circuited
as far as they could the procedure entailed. Properly they ought to
have seen the corrector’s hand before adding their own endorsement.
But if this was not forthcoming, the applicant may have been allowed,
in order to save time, to have the purely trade formalities completed
by a conditional entry, which would be a valid protection against
a rival stationer, but would not, until the corrector’s hand was
obtained, be sufficient authority for the actual printing. No doubt
the clerk should have subsequently endorsed the entry after seeing
the corrector’s hand, but he did not always do so, although in cases
of transfer the transferee might ask for a record to be made, and in
any event the owner of the copy had the book with the ‘hand’ to it.
The Lord Chamberlain’s ‘stay’ was, I think, another matter. I suppose
it to have been directed, not to the correctors, but to the wardens,
and to have taken the form of a request not to enter any play of the
Chamberlain’s men, otherwise entitled to licence or not, without
satisfying themselves that the actors were assenting parties to the
transaction. Common sense would certainly dictate compliance with
such a request, coming from such a source. The plan seems to have
worked well enough so far as <i>As You Like It</i>, <i>Every Man In
his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span> Humour</i>, and <i>Much Ado about Nothing</i> were concerned,
for we have no reason to doubt that the subsequent publication of
two of these plays had the assent of the Chamberlain’s men, and the
third was effectively suppressed. But somehow not only <i>Hamlet</i>
but also <i>The Merry Wives of Windsor</i> slipped through in 1602,
and although the actors apparently came to some arrangement with
Roberts and furnished a revised text of <i>Hamlet</i>, the other play
seems to have gone completely out of their control. Moreover, it was
an obvious weakness of the method adopted, that it gave no security
against a surreptitious printer who was in a position to dispense with
an entry. Danter, after all, had published without entry in 1597. He
had had to go without copyright; but an even more audacious device
was successfully tried in 1600 with <i>Henry V</i>. This was one of
the four plays so scrupulously ‘staied’ by the Stationers’ clerk on 4
August. Not merely, however, was the play printed in 1600 by Thomas
Creede for Thomas Millington and John Busby, but on 21 August it
was entered on the Register as transferred to Thomas Pavier amongst
other ‘thinges formerlye printed and sett ouer to’ him. I think the
explanation is that the print of 1600 was treated as merely a reprint
of the old play of <i>The Famous Victories of Henry V</i>, which was
indeed to some extent Shakespeare’s source, and of which Creede held
the copyright.<a id="FNanchor_615" href="#Footnote_615" class="fnanchor">[615]</a> Similarly, it is conceivable that the same John
Busby and Nathaniel Butter forced the hands of the Chamberlain’s men
into allowing the publication of <i>King Lear</i> in 1608 by a threat
to issue it as a reprint of <i>King Leir</i>.<a id="FNanchor_616" href="#Footnote_616" class="fnanchor">[616]</a> Busby was also the
enterer of <i>The Merry Wives</i>, and he and Butter, at whose hands
it was that Heywood suffered, seem to have been the chief of the
surreptitious printers after Danter’s death.</p>

<p>The Chamberlain’s men would have been in a better position if their
lord had brought his influence to bear, as Sidney’s friends had done,
upon the correctors instead of the Stationers’ Company. Probably
the mistake was retrieved in 1607 when the ‘allowing’ of plays for
publication passed to the Master of the Revels, and he may even
have extended his protection to the other companies which, like the
Chamberlain’s, had now passed under royal protection. I do not suggest
that the convenience of this arrangement was the sole<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span> motive for the
change; the episcopal correctors must have got into a good deal of hot
water over the affair of <i>Eastward Ho!</i><a id="FNanchor_617" href="#Footnote_617" class="fnanchor">[617]</a> Even the Master of
the Revels did not prevent the surreptitious issue of <i>Pericles</i>
in 1609. In Caroline times we find successive Lord Chamberlains, to
whom the Master of the Revels continued to be subordinate, directing
the Stationers’ Company not to allow the repertories of the King’s men
or of Beeston’s boys to be printed, and it is implied that there were
older precedents for these protections.<a id="FNanchor_618" href="#Footnote_618" class="fnanchor">[618]</a></p>

<p>A point might come at which it was really more to the advantage of the
actors to have a play published than not. The prints were useful in
the preparation of acting versions, and they saved the book-keepers
from the trouble of having to prepare manuscript copies at the demand
of stage-struck amateurs.<a id="FNanchor_619" href="#Footnote_619" class="fnanchor">[619]</a> The influence of the poets again was
on the side of publication, and it is perhaps due to the greater
share which they took in the management of the boys’ companies that
so disproportionate a number of the plays preserved are of their
acting. Heywood hints that thereby the poets sold their work twice. It
is more charitable to assume that literary vanity was also a factor;
and it is with playwrights of the more scholarly type, Ben Jonson
and Marston, that a practice first emerges of printing plays at an
early date after publication, and in the full literary trappings of
dedicatory epistles and commendatory verses. Actor-playwrights, such
as Heywood himself and Dekker, followed suit; but not Shakespeare, who
had long ago dedicated his literary all to Southampton and penned no
prefaces. The characteristic Elizabethan apologies, on such grounds as
the pushfulness of publishers or the eagerness of friends to see the
immortal work in type, need not be taken at their full face value.<a id="FNanchor_620" href="#Footnote_620" class="fnanchor">[620]</a>
Opportunity was afforded on publication to restore passages which
had been ‘cut’ to meet the necessities of stage-presentation, and of
this, in the Second Quarto of <i>Hamlet</i>, even Shakespeare may have
availed himself.<a id="FNanchor_621" href="#Footnote_621" class="fnanchor">[621]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span></p>

<p>The conditions of printing therefore furnish us with every variety
of text, from the carefully revised and punctuated versions of Ben
Jonson’s <i>Works</i> of 1616 to the scrappy notes, from memory or
shorthand, of an incompetent reporter. The average text lies between
these extremes, and is probably derived from a play-house ‘book’ handed
over by the actors to the printer. Mr. Pollard has dealt luminously
with the question of the nature of the ‘book’, and has disposed of the
assumption that it was normally a copy made by a ‘play-house’ scrivener
of the author’s manuscript.<a id="FNanchor_622" href="#Footnote_622" class="fnanchor">[622]</a> For this assumption there is no
evidence whatever. There is, indeed, little direct evidence, one way or
other; but what there is points to the conclusion that the ‘original’
or standard copy of a play kept in the play-house was the author’s
autograph manuscript, endorsed with the licence of the Master of the
Revels for performance, and marked by the book-keeper or for his use
with indications of cuts and the like, and with stage-directions for
exits and entrances and the disposition of properties, supplementary
to those which the author had furnished.<a id="FNanchor_623" href="#Footnote_623" class="fnanchor">[623]</a> Most of the actual
manuscripts of this type which remain in existence are of Caroline,
rather than Elizabethan or Jacobean, date.<a id="FNanchor_624" href="#Footnote_624" class="fnanchor">[624]</a> But we have one of
<i>The Second Maid’s Tragedy</i>, bearing Buck’s licence of 1611,
and one of <i>Sir Thomas More</i>, belonging to the last decade of
the sixteenth century, which has been submitted for licence without
success, and is marked with instructions by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span> Master for the
excision or alteration of obnoxious passages. It is a curious document.
The draft of the original author has been patched and interpolated with
partial redrafts in a variety of hands, amongst which, according to
some palaeographers, is to be found that of Shakespeare. One wonders
that any licenser should have been complaisant enough to consider the
play at all in such a form; and obviously the instance is a crucial one
against the theory of scrivener’s copies.<a id="FNanchor_625" href="#Footnote_625" class="fnanchor">[625]</a> It may also be argued
on <i>a priori</i> grounds that such copies would be undesirable from
the company’s point of view, both as being costly and as tending to
multiply the opportunities for ‘surreptitious’ transmission to rivals
or publishers. Naturally it was necessary to copy out individual
parts for the actors, and Alleyn’s part in <i>Orlando Furioso</i>,
with the ‘cues’, or tail ends of the speeches preceding his own, can
still be seen at Dulwich.<a id="FNanchor_626" href="#Footnote_626" class="fnanchor">[626]</a> From these ‘parts’ the ‘original’
could be reconstructed or ‘assembled’ in the event of destruction or
loss.<a id="FNanchor_627" href="#Footnote_627" class="fnanchor">[627]</a> Apparently the book-keeper also made a ‘plot’ or scenario
of the action, and fixed it on a peg for his own guidance and that of
the property-man in securing the smooth progress of the play.<a id="FNanchor_628" href="#Footnote_628" class="fnanchor">[628]</a>
Nor could the companies very well prevent the poets from keeping
transcripts or at any rate rough copies, when they handed over their
‘papers’, complete or in instalments, as they drew their ‘earnests’
or payments ‘in full’.<a id="FNanchor_629" href="#Footnote_629" class="fnanchor">[629]</a> It does not follow that they always did
so. We know that Daborne made fair copies for Henslowe;<a id="FNanchor_630" href="#Footnote_630" class="fnanchor">[630]</a> but the
Folio editors tell us that what Shakespeare thought ‘he vttered with
that easinesse,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span> that we haue scarse receiued from him a blot in his
papers’, and Mr. Pollard points out that there would have been little
meaning in this praise if what Shakespeare sent in had been anything
but his first drafts.<a id="FNanchor_631" href="#Footnote_631" class="fnanchor">[631]</a></p>

<p>The character of the stage-directions in plays confirm the view that
many of them were printed from working play-house ‘originals’. They are
primarily directions for the stage itself; it is only incidentally that
they also serve to stimulate the reader’s imagination by indicating the
action with which the lines before him would have been accompanied in
a representation.<a id="FNanchor_632" href="#Footnote_632" class="fnanchor">[632]</a> Some of them are for the individual guidance of
the actors, marginal hints as to the ‘business’ which will give point
to their speeches. These are not very numerous in play-house texts; the
‘kneeling’ and ‘kisses her’ so frequent in modern editions are merely
attempts of the editors to show how intelligently they have interpreted
the quite obvious implications of the dialogue. The more important
directions are addressed rather to the prompter and the tire-man; they
prescribe the exits and the entrances, the ordering of a procession or
a dumb-show, the use of the curtains or other structural devices, the
introduction of properties, the precise moment for the striking up of
music or sounds ‘within’. It is by no means always possible, except
where a manuscript betrays differences of handwriting, to distinguish
between what the author, often himself an actor familiar with the
possibilities of the stage, may have originally written, and what
the book-keeper may have added. Either may well use the indicative
or the imperative form, or merely an adverbial, participial, or
substantival expression.<a id="FNanchor_633" href="#Footnote_633" class="fnanchor">[633]</a> But it is natural to trace the hand of
the book-keeper where the direction reduces itself to the bare name of
a property noted in the margin; even more so when it is followed by
some such phrase as ‘ready’, ‘prepared’, or ‘set out’;<a id="FNanchor_634" href="#Footnote_634" class="fnanchor">[634]</a> and still
more so when the note occurs at the point when the property has to
be brought from the tire-room,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span> and some lines before it is actually
required for use.<a id="FNanchor_635" href="#Footnote_635" class="fnanchor">[635]</a> The book-keeper must be responsible, too, for
the directions into which, as not infrequently happens, the name of an
actor has been inserted in place of that of the personage whom that
actor represented.<a id="FNanchor_636" href="#Footnote_636" class="fnanchor">[636]</a> On the other hand, we may perhaps safely assign
to the author directions addressed to some one else in the second
person, those which leave something to be interpreted according to
discretion, and those which contain any matter not really necessary
for stage guidance.<a id="FNanchor_637" href="#Footnote_637" class="fnanchor">[637]</a> Such superfluous matter is only rarely found
in texts of pure play-house origin, although even here an author
may occasionally insert a word or two of explanation or descriptive
colouring, possibly taken from the source upon which he has been
working.<a id="FNanchor_638" href="#Footnote_638" class="fnanchor">[638]</a> In the main, however, descriptive stage-directions are
characteristic of texts which, whether ultimately based upon play-house
copies or not, have undergone a process of editing by the author or
his representative, with an eye<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span> to the reader, before publication.
Some literary rehandling of this sort is traceable, for example, in the
First Folio of Shakespeare, although the hearts of the editors seem
to have failed them before they had got very far with the task.<a id="FNanchor_639" href="#Footnote_639" class="fnanchor">[639]</a>
Yet another type of descriptive stage-direction presents itself in
certain ‘surreptitious’ prints, where we find the reporter eking out
his inadequately recorded text by elaborate accounts of the details of
the business which he had seen enacted before him.<a id="FNanchor_640" href="#Footnote_640" class="fnanchor">[640]</a> So too William
Percy, apparently revising plays some of which had already been acted
and which he hoped to see acted again, mingles his suggestions to a
hypothetical manager with narratives in the past tense of how certain
actors had carried out their parts.<a id="FNanchor_641" href="#Footnote_641" class="fnanchor">[641]</a></p>

<p>It must not be assumed that, because a play was printed from a stage
copy, the author had no chance of editing it. Probably the compositors
treated the manuscript put before them very freely, modifying, if they
did not obliterate, the individual notions of the author or scribe as
to orthography and punctuation; and the master printer, or some press
corrector in his employment, went over and ‘improved’ their work,
perhaps not always with much reference to the original ‘copy’.<a id="FNanchor_642" href="#Footnote_642" class="fnanchor">[642]</a>
This process of correction continued during the printing off of the
successive sheets, with the result that different examples of the same
imprint often show the same sheet in corrected and in uncorrected
states.<a id="FNanchor_643" href="#Footnote_643" class="fnanchor">[643]</a> The trend of modern criticism is in the direction of
regarding Shakespeare’s plays as printed, broadly speaking, without
any editorial assistance from him; the early quartos from play-house
manuscripts, the later quartos from the earlier quartos, the folio
partly from play-house manuscripts, partly from earlier quartos used in
the play-house instead of manuscripts, and bearing marks of adaptation
to shifting stage requirements.<a id="FNanchor_644" href="#Footnote_644" class="fnanchor">[644]</a> On this theory, the aberrations
of the printing-house, even with the author’s original text before
them, have to account in the main for the unsatisfactory condition in
which, in spite of such posthumous editing, not very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span> extensive, as was
done for the folio, even the best texts of the plays have reached us.
Whether it is sound or not&mdash;I think that it probably is&mdash;there were
other playwrights who were far from adopting Shakespeare’s attitude of
detachment from the literary fate of his works. Jonson was a careful
editor. Marston, Middleton, and Heywood all apologize for misprints in
various plays, which they say were printed without their knowledge, or
when they were urgently occupied elsewhere; and the inference must be
that in normal circumstances the responsibility would have rested with
them.<a id="FNanchor_645" href="#Footnote_645" class="fnanchor">[645]</a> Marston, indeed, definitely says that he had ‘perused’ the
second edition of <i>The Fawn</i>, in order ‘to make some satisfaction
for the first faulty impression’.<a id="FNanchor_646" href="#Footnote_646" class="fnanchor">[646]</a></p>

<p>The modern editions, with their uniform system of acts and scenes and
their fanciful notes of locality&mdash;‘A room in the palace’, ‘Another
room in the palace’&mdash;are again misleading in their relation to the
early prints, especially those based upon the play-house. Notes of
locality are very rare. Occasionally a definite shift from one country
or town to another is recorded;<a id="FNanchor_647" href="#Footnote_647" class="fnanchor">[647]</a> and a few edited plays, such as
Ben Jonson’s, prefix, with a ‘dramatis personae’, a general indication
of ‘The scene’.<a id="FNanchor_648" href="#Footnote_648" class="fnanchor">[648]</a> For the rest, the reader is left to his own
inferences, with such help as the dialogue and the presenters give him;
and the modern editors, with a post-Restoration tradition of staging
in their minds, have often inferred wrongly. Even the shoulder-notes
appended to the accurate reprints of the Malone Society, although they
do not attempt localities, err by introducing too many new scenes.
In the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span> early prints the beginnings of scenes are rarely marked, and
the beginnings of acts are left unmarked to an extent which is rather
surprising. The practice is by no means uniform, and it is possible
to distinguish different tendencies in texts of different origin. The
Tudor interludes and the early Elizabethan plays of the more popular
type are wholly undivided, and there was probably no break in the
continuity of the performances.<a id="FNanchor_649" href="#Footnote_649" class="fnanchor">[649]</a> Acts and scenes, which are the
outward form of a method of construction derived from the academic
analysis of Latin comedy and tragedy, make their appearance, with other
notes of neo-classic influence, in the farces of the school of Udall,
in the Court tragedies, in translated plays, in Lyly’s comedies, and in
a few others belonging to the same <i>milieu</i> of scholarship.<a id="FNanchor_650" href="#Footnote_650" class="fnanchor">[650]</a>
Ben Jonson and a few other later writers adopt them in printing plays
of theatrical origin.<a id="FNanchor_651" href="#Footnote_651" class="fnanchor">[651]</a> But the great majority of plays belonging
to the public theatres continue to be printed without any divisions
at all, while plays from the private houses are ordinarily divided
into acts, but not into scenes, although the beginning of each act has
usually some such heading as ‘Actus Primus, Scena prima’.<a id="FNanchor_652" href="#Footnote_652" class="fnanchor">[652]</a> This
distinction corresponds to the greater significance of the act-interval
in the performance of the boy companies; but, as I have pointed out
in an earlier chapter, it is difficult to suppose that the public
theatres paid no regard to act-intervals, and one cannot therefore
quite understand why neither the poets nor the book-keepers were in the
habit of showing them in the play-house ‘originals’ of plays.<a id="FNanchor_653" href="#Footnote_653" class="fnanchor">[653]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
Had they been shown there, they would almost inevitably have got into
the prints. It is a peculiarity of the surreptitious First Quarto
of <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>, that its later sheets, which differ
typographically from the earlier ones, although they do not number
either acts or scenes, insert lines of ornament at the points at which
acts and scenes may be supposed to begin. It must be added that, so far
as an Elizabethan playwright looked upon his work as made up of scenes,
his conception of a scene was not as a rule that familiar to us upon
the modern stage. The modern scene may be defined as a piece of action
continuous in time and place between two falls of a drop-curtain. The
Elizabethans had no drop-curtain, and the drawing of an alcove curtain,
at any rate while personages remain on the stage without, does not
afford the same solution of continuity. The nearest analogy is perhaps
in such a complete clearance of the stage, generally with a shift of
locality, as enables the imagination to assume a time interval. A few
texts, generally of the seventeenth century, are divided into scenes
on this principle of clearance; and it was adopted by the editors of
the First Folio, when, in a half-hearted way, they attempted to divide
up the continuous texts of their manuscripts and quartos.<a id="FNanchor_654" href="#Footnote_654" class="fnanchor">[654]</a> But it
was not the principle of the neo-classic dramatists, or of Ben Jonson
and his school. For them a scene was a section, not of action, but
of dialogue; and they started a new scene whenever a speaker, or at
any rate a speaker of importance, entered or left the stage. This is
the conception which is in the mind of Marston when he regrets, in
the preface to <i>The Malcontent</i>, that ‘scenes, invented merely
to be spoken, should be enforcively published to be read’. It is also
the conception of the French classicist drama, although the English
playwrights do not follow the French rule of <i>liaison</i>, which
requires at least one speaker from each scene to remain on into the
next, and thus secures continuity throughout each act by making a
complete clearance of the stage impossible.<a id="FNanchor_655" href="#Footnote_655" class="fnanchor">[655]</a></p>

<p>[<i>Bibliographical Note.</i>&mdash;The abundant literature of
the drama is more satisfactorily treated in the appendices
to F. E. Schelling, <i>Elizabethan Drama</i> (1908), and
vols. v and vi (1910) of the <i>Cambridge History of English
Literature</i>, than in R. W. Lowe, <i>Bibliographical Account
of English Theatrical Literature</i> (1888), K. L. Bates and
L. B. Godfrey, <i>English Drama: a Working Basis</i> (1896),
or W. D. Adams, <i>Dictionary of the Drama</i> (1904). There
is an American pamphlet on <i>Materials for the Study of the
English Drama, excluding Shakespeare</i> (1912, Newbery Library,
Chicago), which I have not seen. Periodical lists of new
books are published in the <i>Modern Language Review</i>, the
<i>Beiblatt</i> to <i>Anglia</i>, and the <i>Bulletin</i> of the
English Association, and annual bibliographies by the <i>Modern
Humanities Research Association</i> (from 1921) and in the
Shakespeare <i>Jahrbuch</i>. The bibliography by H. R. Tedder in
the <i>Encyclopaedia Britannica</i> (11th ed.) s.v. Shakespeare,
A. C. Shaw, <i>Index to the Shakespeare Memorial Library</i>
(1900–3), and W. Jaggard, <i>Shakespeare Bibliography</i>
(1911), on which, however, cf. C. S. Northup in <i>J. G. P.</i>
xi. 218, are also useful.</p>

<p>W. W. Greg, <i>Notes on Dramatic Bibliographers</i> (1911, <i>M.
S. C.</i> i. 324), traces from the publishers’ advertisements
of the Restoration a <i>catena</i> of play-lists in E.
Phillips, <i>Theatrum Poetarum</i> (1675), W. Winstanley,
<i>Lives of the Most Famous English Poets</i> (1687), G.
Langbaine, <i>Momus Triumphans</i> (1688) and <i>Account of
the English Dramatick Poets</i> (1691), C. Gildon, <i>Lives
and Characters of the English Dramatick Poets</i> (1698), W.
R. Chetwood, <i>The British Theatre</i> (1750), E. Capell,
<i>Notitia Dramatica</i> (1783), and the various editions of
the <i>Biographica Dramatica</i> from 1764 to 1812. More recent
are J. O. Halliwell-Phillipps, <i>Dictionary of Old English
Plays</i> (1860), and W. C. Hazlitt, <i>Manual of Old English
Plays</i> (1892); but all are largely superseded by W. W. Greg,
<i>A List of English Plays</i> (1900) and <i>A List of Masques,
Pageants, &amp;c.</i> (1902). His account of Warburton’s collection
in <i>The Bakings of Betsy</i> (<i>Library</i>, 1911) serves as
a supplement. A few plays discovered later than 1900 appeared
in an Irish sale of 1906 (cf. <i>Jahrbuch</i>, xliii. 310) and
in the Mostyn sale of 1919 (cf. t.p. facsimiles in Sotheby’s
sale catalogue). For the problems of the early prints, the
<i>Bibliographical Note</i> to ch. xxii should be consulted.</p>

<p>I ought to add that the notices of the early prints of plays
in this and the following chapter lay no claim to minute
bibliographical erudition, and that all deficiencies in this
respect are likely to be corrected when the full results of Dr.
Greg’s researches on the subject are published.</p>

<p>The fundamental works on the history of the drama are A. W.
Ward, <i>History of English Dramatic Literature</i> (1875,
1899), F. G. Fleay, <i>Biographical Chronicle of the English
Drama</i> (1891), F. E. Schelling, <i>Elizabethan Drama</i>
(1908), the <i>Cambridge History of English Literature</i>,
vols. v and vi (1910), and W. Creizenach, <i>Geschichte des
neueren Dramas</i>, vols. iv, v (1909, 1916). These and others,
with the relevant periodicals, are set out in the <i>General
Bibliographical Note</i> (vol. i); and to them may be added
F. S. Boas, <i>Shakspere and his Predecessors</i> (1896), B.
Matthews, <i>The Development of the Drama</i> (1904), F. E.
Schelling, <i>English Drama</i> (1914), A. Wynne, <i>The Growth
of English Drama</i> (1914). Less systematic collections of

(1889), J. R. Lowell, <i>Old English Dramatists</i> (1892), A.
H. Tolman, <i>The Views about Hamlet</i> (1904), C. Crawford,
<i>Collectanea</i> (1906–7), A. C. Swinburne, <i>The Age of
Shakespeare</i> (1908). The older critical work of Charles Lamb,
William Hazlitt, and others cannot be neglected, but need not be
detailed here.</p>

<p>The special problem of the authorship of the so-called
<i>Shakespeare Apocrypha</i> is dealt with in the editions
thereof described below, and by Halliwell-Phillipps (ii. 413),
Ward (ii. 209), R. Sachs, <i>Die Shakespeare zugeschriebenen
zweifelhaften Stücke</i> (1892, <i>Jahrbuch</i>, xxvii), and
A. F. Hopkinson, <i>Essays on Shakespeare’s Doubtful Plays</i>
(1900). The analogous question of the possible non-Shakespearian
authorship of plays or parts of plays published as his is too
closely interwoven with specifically Shakespearian literature to
be handled here; J. M. Robertson, in <i>Did Shakespeare Write
Titus Andronicus?</i> (1905), <i>Shakespeare and Chapman</i>
(1917), <i>The Shakespeare Canon</i> (1922), is searching;
other dissertations are cited under the plays or playwrights
concerned. The attempts to use metrical or other ‘tests’ in the
discrimination of authorship or of the chronology of work have
been predominantly applied to Shakespeare, although Beaumont and
Fletcher (<i>vide infra</i>) and others have not been neglected.
The broader discussions of E. N. S. Thompson, <i>Elizabethan
Dramatic Collaboration</i> (1909, <i>E. S.</i> xl. 30) and E. H.
C. Oliphant, <i>Problems of Authorship in Elizabethan Dramatic
Literature</i> (1911, <i>M. P.</i> viii, 411) are of value.</p>

<p>[In this chapter I give under the head of each playwright (<i>a</i>) a
brief sketch of his life in relation to the stage, (<i>b</i>) a list of
contemporary and later collections of his dramatic works, (<i>c</i>) a
list of dissertations (books, pamphlets, articles in journals) bearing
generally upon his life and works. Then I take each play, mask, &amp;c., up
to 1616 and give (<i>a</i>) the MSS. if any; (<i>b</i>) the essential
parts of the entry, if any, on the Stationers’ Register, including
in brackets the name of any licenser other than an official of the
Company, and occasionally adding a note of any transfer of copyright
which seems of exceptional interest; (<i>c</i>) the essential parts
of the title-page of the first known print; (<i>d</i>) a note of
its prologues, epilogues, epistles, and other introductory matter;
(<i>e</i>) the dates and imprints of later prints before the end of
the seventeenth century with any new matter from their t.ps. bearing
on stage history; (<i>f</i>) lists of all important 18th-20th century
editions and dissertations, not of the collective or general type
already dealt with; (<i>g</i>) such notes as may seem desirable on
authorship, date, stage history and the like. Some of these notes are
little more than compilations; others contain the results of such work
as I have myself been able to do on the plays concerned. Similarly,
I have in some cases recorded, on the authority of others, editions
and dissertations which I have not personally examined. The section
devoted to each playwright concludes with lists of work not extant and
of work of which his authorship has, often foolishly, been conjectured.
I ought to make it clear that many of my title-pages are borrowed from
Dr. Greg, and that, while I have tried to give what is useful for
the history of the stage, I have no competence in matters of minute
bibliographical accuracy.]</p>


<p class="p-left p2">WILLIAM ALABASTER (1567–1640)</p>

<p>Alabaster, or Alablaster, was born at Hadleigh, Suffolk, in 1567 and
entered Trinity College, Cambridge, from Westminster in 1583. His Latin
poem <i>Eliseis</i> is mentioned by Spenser in <i>Colin Clout’s Come
Home Again</i> (1591). He was incorporated M.A. of Oxford in 1592,
and went as chaplain to Essex in the Cadiz expedition of 1596. On 22
Sept. 1597 Richard Percival wrote to Sir Robert Cecil (<i>Hatfield
MSS.</i> vii. 394), ‘Alabaster has made a tragedy against the Church of
England’. Perhaps this is not to be taken literally, but only refers to
his conversion to Catholicism. Chamberlain, 7, 64, records that he was
‘clapt up for poperie’, had escaped from the Clink by 4 May 1598, but
was recaptured at Rochelle. This was about the beginning of Aug. 1599
(<i>Hatfield MSS.</i> ix. 282). Later he was reconverted and at his
death in 1640 held the living of Therfield, Herts. He wrote on mystical
theology, and a manuscript collection of 43 sonnets, mostly unprinted,
is described by B. Dobell in <i>Athenaeum</i> (1903), ii. 856.</p>

Hollandius and Tho. Farnabius; engraved title-page, with representation

<p>The Epistle has ‘Ante quadraginta plus minus annos, morticinum

Groto’s <i>La Dalida</i> (1567).</p>


<p class="p-left p2">SIR WILLIAM ALEXANDER, EARL OF STIRLING (<i>c.</i> 1568–1640).</p>

<p>William Alexander of Menstrie, after an education at Glasgow and Leyden
and travel in France, Spain, and Italy, was tutor to Prince Henry
before the accession of James, and afterwards Gentleman extraordinary
of the Privy Chamber both to Henry and to Charles. He was knighted
about 1609, appointed a Master of Requests in 1614 and Secretary for
Scotland in 1626. He was created Earl of Stirling in 1633. He formed
literary friendships with Michael Drayton and William Drummond of
Hawthornden, but Jonson complained (Laing, 11) that ‘Sir W. Alexander
was not half kinde unto him, and neglected him, because a friend to
Drayton’. His four tragedies read like closet plays, and his only
connexion with the stage appears to be in some verses to Alleyn after
the foundation of Dulwich in 1619 (Collier, <i>Memoirs of Alleyn</i>,
178).</p>

<p>Alley’s Πτωχὸμυσεῖον. <i>The Poore Mans Librarie</i> (1565)
contains three and a half pages of dialogue between Larymos and
Phronimos, described as from ‘a certaine interlude or plaie intituled
<i>Aegio</i>. In the which playe ij persons interlocutorie do dispute,
the one alledging for the defence of destenie and fatall necessitie,
and the other confuting the same’. P. Simpson (<i>9 N. Q.</i> iii. 205)
suggests that Alley was probably himself the author. The book consists
of <i>praelectiones</i> delivered in 1561 at St. Paul’s, of which Alley
had been a Prebendary. He became Bishop of Exeter in 1560. On his
attitude to the public stage, cf. App. C. No. viii. It is therefore odd
to find the Lord Bishop’s players at Barnstaple and Plymouth in 1560–1
(Murray, ii. 78).</p>

was ‘acted by the boyes of the Reuels, which perchaunce in part was
sometime acted more naturally in the Citty, if not in the hole’, that
the writer ‘would haue againe inacted Iohn my selfe but ... I cannot
do as I would’, and that he had been ‘requested both of Court and
Citty, to show him in priuate’. John is figured in a woodcut on the
title-page, which is perhaps meant for a portrait of Armin. As a King’s
man, and no boy, he can hardly have played with the King’s Revels;
perhaps we should infer that the play was not originally written for
them. All their productions seem to date from 1607–8.</p>

<p class="p-left p2">THOMAS ASHTON (<i>ob.</i> 1578).</p>

<p>Ashton took his B.A. in 1559–60, and became Fellow of Trinity,
Cambridge. He was appointed Head Master of Shrewsbury School from 24
June 1561 (G. W. Fisher, <i>Annals of Shrewsbury School</i>, 4). To the
same year a local record, Robert Owen’s <i>Arms of the Bailiffs</i>
(17th c.), assigns ‘M<sup>r</sup> Astons first playe upon the Passion of Christ’,
and this is confirmed by an entry in the town accounts (Owen and
Blakeway, <i>Hist. of Shrewsbury</i>, i. 353) of 20s. ‘spent upon
M<sup>r</sup> Aston and a other gentellmane of Cambridge over pareadijs’ on 25
May 1561. Whitsuntide plays had long been traditional at Shrewsbury
(<i>Mediaeval Stage</i>, ii. 250, 394, where the dates require
correction). A local chronicle (<i>Shropshire Arch. Soc. Trans.</i>
xxxvii. 54) has ‘Elizabeth 1565 [i. e. 1566; cf. App. A], The Queen
came to Coventry intending for Salop to see M<sup>r</sup> Astons Play, but it was
ended. The Play was performed in the Quarry, and lasted the Whitson
[June 2] hollydays’. This play is given in <i>Mediaeval Stage</i>, from
local historians, as <i>Julian the Apostate</i>, but the same chronicle
assigns that to 1556. Another chronicle (<i>Taylor MS.</i> of 16th-17th
c.) records for 1568–9 (<i>Shropshire Arch. Soc. Trans.</i> iii. 268),
‘This yeare at Whytsoontyde [29 May] was a notable stage playe playeed
in Shrosberie in a place there callyd the quarrell which lastid all
the hollydayes unto the which cam greate number of people of noblemen
and others the which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span> was praysed greatlye and the chyff aucter therof
was one Master Astoon beinge the head scoolemaster of the freescole
there a godly and lernyd man who tooke marvelous greate paynes therin’.
Robert Owen, who calls this Aston’s ‘great playe’ of the <i>Passion of
Christ</i>, assigns it to 1568, but it is clear from the town accounts
that 1569 is right (Fisher, 18). This is presumably the play referred
to by Thomas Churchyard (q.v.) in <i>The Worthiness of Wales</i> (1587,
ed. Spenser Soc. 85), where after describing ‘behind the walles ...
a ground, newe made Theator wise’, able to seat 10,000, and used for
plays, baiting, cockfights, and wrestling, he adds:</p>

  <div class="poetry-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div>At Astons Play, who had beheld this then,</div>
        <div>Might well have seene there twentie thousand men.</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

<p class="p-left">In the margin he comments, ‘Maister Aston was a good and
godly Preacher’. A ‘ludus in quarell’ is noted in 1495, and this was
‘where the plases [? playes] have bine accustomyd to be usyd’ in 1570
(<i>Mediaeval Stage</i>, ii. 251, 255). Ashton resigned his Mastership
about 1571 and was in the service of the Earl of Essex at Chartley in
1573. But he continued to work on the Statutes of the school, which as
settled in 1578, the year of his death, provide that ‘Everie Thursdaie
the Schollers of the first forme before they goo to plaie shall for
exercise declame and plaie one acte of a comedie’ (Fisher, 17, 23; E.
Calvert, <i>Shrewsbury School Register</i>). It is interesting to note
that among Ashton’s pupils were Sir Philip Sidney and Fulke Greville,
Lord Brooke, who entered the school together on 16 Nov. 1564.</p>

<p class="p-left p2">FRANCIS BACON (1561–1626).</p>

<p>Bacon was son of Sir Nicholas Bacon, Lord Keeper, by Anne, daughter
of Sir Anthony Cooke. He was at Trinity, Cambridge, from April 1573
to March 1575, and entered Gray’s Inn in June 1576. He sat in the
Parliaments of 1584 and 1586, and about 1591 attached himself to the
rising fortunes of the Earl of Essex, who in 1595 gave him an estate
at Twickenham. His public employment began as a Queen’s Counsel about
1596. He was knighted on 23 July 1603, became Solicitor-General on 25
June 1607, Attorney-General on 27 Oct. 1613, Lord Keeper on 7 March
1617, and Lord Chancellor on 7 Jan. 1618. He was created Lord Verulam
on 12 July 1618, and Viscount St. Albans on 27 Jan. 1621. Later in the
same year he was disgraced for bribery. The edition of his <i>Works</i>
(with his <i>Letters and Life</i>) by J. Spedding, R. L. Ellis, and D.
D. Heath (1857–74) is exhaustive. Many papers of his brother Anthony
are at Lambeth, and are drawn on by T. Birch, <i>Memoirs of the Reign
of Elizabeth</i> (1754). F. J. Burgoyne, <i>Facsimile of a Manuscript
at Alnwick</i> (1904), reproduces<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span> the <i>Northumberland MS.</i> which
contains some of his writings, with others that may be his, and seems
once to have contained more. Apart from philosophy, his chief literary
work was <i>The Essayes or Counsels, Civill and Morall</i>, of which
10 appeared in 1597, and were increased to 38 in 1612 and 58 in 1625.
Essay xxxvii, added in 1625, is <i>Of Masks and Triumphs</i>, and,
although Bacon was not a writer for the public stage, he had a hand, as
deviser or patron, in several courtly shows.</p>

<p>(i) He helped to devise dumb-shows for Thomas Hughes’s <i>Misfortunes
of Arthur</i> (q.v.) given by Gray’s Inn at Greenwich on 28 Feb. 1588.</p>

<p>(ii) The list of contents of the <i>Northumberland MS.</i> (Burgoyne,
xii) includes an item, now missing from the MS., ‘Orations at Graies
Inne Revells’, and Spedding, viii. 342, conjectures that Bacon wrote
the speeches of the six councillors delivered on 3 Jan. 1595 as part of
the <i>Gesta Grayorum</i> (q.v.).</p>

<p>(iii) Rowland Whyte (<i>Sydney Papers</i>, i. 362) describes a device
on the Queen’s day (17 Nov.), 1595, in which the speeches turned on the
Earl of Essex’s love for Elizabeth, who said that, ‘if she had thought
there had been so much said of her, she would not have been there that
night’. A draft list of tilters, of whom the challengers were led by
the Earl of Cumberland and the defendants by the Earl of Essex, is in
<i>Various MSS.</i> iv. 163, and a final one, with descriptions of
their appearance, in the <i>Anglorum Feriae</i> of Peele (q.v.). They
were Cumberland, Knight of the Crown, Essex, Sussex, Southampton, as
Sir Bevis, Bedford, Compton, Carew, the three brothers Knollys, Dudley,
William Howard, Drury, Nowell, John Needham, Skydmore, Ratcliffe,
Reynolds, Charles Blount, Carey. The device took place partly in the
tiltyard, partly after supper. Before the entry of the tilters a page
made a speech and secured the Queen’s glove. A dialogue followed
between a Squire on one hand, and a Hermit, a Secretary, and a Soldier,
who on the entry of Essex tried to beguile him from love. A postboy
brought letters, which the Secretary gave to Essex. After supper,
the argument between the Squire and the three tempters was resumed.
Whyte adds, ‘The old man [the Hermit] was he that in Cambridg played
Giraldy; Morley played the Secretary; and he that plaid Pedantiq was
the soldior; and Toby Matthew acted the Squires part. The world makes
many untrue constructions of these speaches, comparing the Hermitt and
the Secretary to two of the Lords [Burghley and Robert Cecil?]; and the
soldier to Sir Roger Williams.’ The Cambridge reference is apparently
to <i>Laelia</i> (q.v.) and the performers of the Hermit and Soldier
were therefore George Meriton and George Mountaine, of Queen’s. Morley
might perhaps be Thomas Morley, the musician, a Gentleman of the Chapel.</p>

<p>Several speeches, apparently belonging to this device, are preserved.
Peele speaks of the balancing of Essex between war and statecraft as
indicated in the tiltyard by ‘His mute approach and action of his
mutes’, but they may have presented a written speech.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span></p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) <i>Lambeth MS.</i> v. 118 (copied by Birch in <i>Sloane
MS.</i> 4457, f. 32) has, in Bacon’s hand, a speech by the Squire in
the tiltyard, and four speeches by the Hermit, Soldier, Secretary, and
Squire ‘in the Presence’. These are printed by Birch (1763), Nichols,
<i>Eliz.</i> iii. 372, and Spedding, viii. 378.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) <i>Lambeth MS.</i> viii. 274 (copied by Birch in <i>Addl.
MS.</i> 4164, f. 167) has, in Bacon’s hand, the beginning of a speech
by the Secretary to the Squire, which mentions Philautia and Erophilus,
and a letter from Philautia to the Queen. These are printed in
Spedding, viii. 376.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) The <i>Northumberland MS.</i> ff. 47–53 (Burgoyne, 55)
has ‘Speeches for my Lord of Essex at the tylt’. These deal with the
attempts of Philautia to beguile Erophilus. Four of them are identical
with the four speeches ‘in the Presence’ of (<i>a</i>); the fifth is a
speech by the Hermit in the tiltyard. They were printed by Spedding,
separately, in 1870, as <i>A Conference of Pleasure composed for some
festive occasion about the year 1592 by Francis Bacon</i>; but 1592 is
merely a guess which Whyte’s letter corrects.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) <i>S. P. D. Eliz.</i> ccliv. 67, 68, docketed ‘A Device
made by the Earl of Essex for the Entertainment of her Majesty’, has
a speech by the Squire, distinct from any in the other MSS., a speech
by the Attendant on an Indian Prince, which mentions Philautia, and
a draft by Edward Reynolds, servant to Essex, of a French speech by
Philautia. The two first of these are printed by Spedding, viii.
388, and Devereux, <i>Lives of the Earls of Essex</i>, ii. 501. The
references to Philautia are rather against Spedding’s view that these
belong to some occasion other than that of 1595.</p>

<p>Sir Henry Wotton says of Essex (<i>Reliquiae Wottonianae</i>, 21), ‘For
his Writings, they are beyond example, especially in his ... things of
delight at Court ... as may be yet seen in his Impresses and Inventions
of entertainment; and above all in his darling piece of love, and self
love’. This, for what it is worth&mdash;and Wotton was secretary to Essex
in 1595, suggests that the Earl himself, rather than Bacon, was the
author of the speeches, which in fact none of the MSS. directly ascribe
to Bacon. But it is hard to distinguish the literary productions of a
public man from those of his staff.</p>

<p>(iv) The <i>Northumberland MS.</i> (Burgoyne, 65) has a speech of
apology for absence, headed ‘ffor the Earle of Sussex at y<sup>e</sup> tilt an:
96’, which might be Bacon’s, especially as he wrote from Gray’s Inn to
the Earl of Shrewsbury on 15 Oct. 1596, ‘to borrow a horse and armour
for some public show’ (Lodge, <i>App.</i> 79).</p>

<p>(v) Beaumont (q.v.) acknowledges his encouragement of the Inner Temple
and Gray’s Inn mask on 20 Feb. 1613, for the Princess Elizabeth’s
wedding.</p>

<p>(vi) He bore the expenses of the Gray’s Inn <i>Mask of Flowers</i>
(q.v.) on 6 Jan. 1614 for the Earl of Somerset’s wedding. To this
occasion probably belongs an undated letter signed ‘Fr. Bacon’, and
addressed to an unknown lord (<i>M. S. C.</i> i. 214 from <i>Lansdowne
MS.</i> 107, f. 13; Spedding, ii. 370; iv. 394), in which he expresses
regret that ‘the joynt maske from the fowr Innes of Cowrt faileth’,
and offers a mask<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span> for ‘this occasion’ by a dozen gentlemen of Gray’s
Inn, ‘owt of the honor which they bear to your lordship, and my lord
Chamberlayne, to whome at theyr last maske they were so much bownde’.
The last mask would be (v) above, and the then Lord Chamberlain was
Suffolk, prospective father-in-law of Somerset, to whom the letter may
be supposed to be addressed. But it is odd that the letter is endorsed
‘M<sup>r</sup>’ Fr. Bacon, and bound up with papers of Burghley, and it is just
possible, although not, I think, likely, that the reference may be to
some forgotten Elizabethan mask.</p>

<p>(vii) A recent attempt has been made to assign to Bacon the academic
<i>Pedantius</i> (cf. App. K).</p>

<p class="p-left p2">BARNABE BARNES (<i>c.</i> 1569–1609).</p>

<p>Barnes was born in Yorkshire, the son of Richard Barnes, bishop of
Durham. He entered Brasenose College, Oxford, in 1586, but took no
degree, accompanied Essex to France in 1591, and dedicated his poems
<i>Parthenophil and Parthenophe</i> (1593) to William Percy (q.v.).
He was a friend of Gabriel Harvey and abused by Nashe and Campion.
In 1598 he was charged with an attempt at poison, but escaped from
prison (<i>Athenaeum</i>, 1904, ii. 240). His <i>Poems</i> were
edited by A. B. Grosart in <i>Occasional Issues</i> (1875). Hazlitt,
<i>Manual</i>, 23, states that a manuscript of a play by him with the
title <i>The Battle of Hexham</i> was sold with Isaac Reed’s books in
1807, but this, which some writers call <i>The Battle of Evesham</i>,
has not been traced. As Barnes was buried at Durham in Dec. 1609, it
is probable that <i>The Madcap</i> ‘written by Barnes’, which Herbert
licensed for Prince Charles’s men on 3 May 1624, was by another of the
name.</p>

(ed. Dodsley, pp. 280, 348, 369) to the baboons, which apparently
amused London about 1603–5 (cf. s.v. <i>Sir Giles Goosecap</i>), and to

<p class="p-left p2">FRANCIS BEAUMONT (<i>c.</i> 1584–1616).</p>

<p>Beaumont was third son of Francis Beaumont, Justice of Common Pleas,
sprung from a gentle Leicestershire family, settled at Grace Dieu
priory in Charnwood Forest. He was born in 1584 or 1585 and had a
brother, Sir John, also known as a poet. He entered Broadgates Hall,
Oxford, in 1597, but took no degree, and the Inner Temple in 1600. In
1614 or 1615 he had a daughter by his marriage, probably recent, to
Ursula Isley of Sundridge Hall, Kent, and another daughter was born
after his death on 6 March 1616. He was buried in Westminster Abbey.</p>

<p>Beaumont contributed a humorous grammar lecture (preserved in <i>Sloane
MS.</i> 1709, f. 13; cf. E. J. L. Scott in <i>Athenaeum</i> for 27 Jan.
1894) to some Inner Temple Christmas revels of uncertain date. This has
allusions to ‘the most plodderly plotted shew of Lady Amity’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span> given ‘in
this ill-instructed hall the last Christmas’, and to seeing a play at
the Bankside for sixpence. His poetical career probably begins with the
anonymous <i>Salmacis and Hermaphroditus</i> of 1602. His non-dramatic
poems, of which the most important is an epistle to Elizabeth Countess
of Rutland in 1612, appeared after his death in volumes of 1618, 1640,
and 1653, which certainly ascribe to him much that is not his. His
connexion with the stage seems to have begun about 1606, possibly
through Michael Drayton, a family friend, in whose <i>Eglogs</i> of
that year he appears as ‘sweet Palmeo’. But his first play, <i>The
Woman Hater</i>, written independently for Paul’s, shows him under the
influence of Ben Jonson, who wrote him an affectionate epigram (lv),
told Drummond in 1619 that ‘Francis Beaumont loved too much himself
and his own verses’ (Laing, 10), and according to Dryden (<i>Essay
on Dramatick Poesie</i>) ‘submitted all his writings to his censure,
and, ’tis thought, used his judgment in correcting, if not contriving,
all his plots’. To Jonson’s <i>Volpone</i> (1607) commendatory verses
were contributed both by Beaumont, whose own <i>Knight of the Burning
Pestle</i> was produced in the same year, and by John Fletcher, whose
names are thus first combined. Jonson and Beaumont, in their turn,
wrote verses for Fletcher’s <i>The Faithful Shepherdess</i>, probably
written in 1608 or 1609 and published in 1609 or 1610. About 1608 or
1609 it may also be supposed that the famous literary collaboration
began. This, although it can only be proved to have covered some
half-dozen plays, left the two names so closely associated that when,
in 1647 and 1679, the actors and publishers issued collections of
fifty-three pieces, in all or most of which Fletcher had had, or was
supposed to have had, a hand, they described them all as ‘by Francis
Beaumont and John Fletcher’, and thus left to modern scholarship a task
with which it is still grappling. A contemporary protest by Sir Aston
Cockaine pointed out the small share of Beaumont and the large share
of Massinger in the 1647 volume; and the process of metrical analysis
initiated by Fleay and Boyle may be regarded as fairly successful
in fixing the characteristics of the very marked style of Fletcher,
although it certainly raises more questions than it solves as to the
possible shares not only of Massinger, but of Jonson, Field, Tourneur,
Daborne, Middleton, Rowley, and Shirley, as collaborators or revisers,
in the plays as they have come down to us. Since Fletcher wrote up to
his death in 1625, much of this investigation lies outside my limits,
and it is fortunate that the task of selecting the plays which may,
certainly or possibly, fall before Beaumont’s death in 1616 is one
in which a fair number of definite data are available to eke out the
slippery metrical evidence. It would seem that the collaboration began
about 1608 and lasted in full swing for about four or five years, that
in it Beaumont was the ruling spirit, and that it covered plays, not
only for the Queen’s Revels, for whom both poets had already written
independently, and for their successors the Lady Elizabeth’s, but
also, and concurrently, for the King’s. According to Dryden, two or
three plays were written ‘very unsuccessfully’ before the triumph
of <i>Philaster</i>, but these may include the independent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span> plays,
of which we know that the <i>Knight of the Burning Pestle</i> and
the <i>Faithful Shepherdess</i> failed. The Folios contain a copy of
verses written by Beaumont to Jonson (ed. Waller, x. 199) ‘before he
and M<sup>r</sup>. Fletcher came to <i>London</i>, with two of the precedent
Comedies then not finish’d, which deferr’d their merry meetings
at the <i>Mermaid</i>’, but this probably relates to a temporary
<i>villeggiatura</i> and cannot be precisely dated. It is no doubt to
this period of 1608–13 that we may refer the gossip of Aubrey, i. 96,
who learnt from Sir James Hales and others that Beaumont and Fletcher
‘lived together on the Banke-Side, not far from the Play-house, both
batchelors; lay together; had one wench in the house between them,
which they did so admire; the same cloathes and cloake, &amp;c., betweene
them’. Obviously these conditions ended when Beaumont married an
heiress about 1613, and it seems probable that from this date onwards
he ceased to be an active playwright, although he contributed a mask to
the Princess Elizabeth’s wedding at Shrovetide of that year, and his
hand can be traced, perhaps later still, in <i>The Scornful Lady</i>.
At any rate, about 1613 Fletcher was not merely writing independent
plays&mdash;a practice which, unlike Beaumont, he may never have wholly
dropped&mdash;but also looking about for other contributors. There is
some converging evidence of his collaboration about this date with
Shakespeare; and Henslowe’s correspondence (<i>Henslowe Papers</i>, 66)
shows him quite clearly as engaged on a play, possibly <i>The Honest
Man’s Fortune</i>, with no less than three others, Daborne, Field, and
Massinger. It is not probable that, from 1616 onwards, Fletcher wrote
for any company but the King’s men. Of the fifty-two plays included
in the Ff., forty-four can be shown from title-pages, actor-lists,
licences by the Master of the Revels, and a Lord Chamberlain’s order
of 1641 (<i>M. S. C.</i> i. 364) to have belonged to the King’s, six
by title-pages and another Lord Chamberlain’s order (<i>Variorum</i>,
iii. 159) to have belonged to the Cockpit theatre, and two, <i>Wit at
Several Weapons</i> and <i>Four Plays in One</i>, together with <i>The
Faithful Friends</i>, which does not appear in the Ff., cannot be
assigned to any company. But some of the King’s men’s plays and some
or all of the Cockpit plays had originally belonged to Paul’s, the
Queen’s Revels, or the Lady Elizabeth’s, and it is probable that all
these formed part of the Lady Elizabeth’s repertory in 1616, and that
upon the reorganization of the company which then took place they were
divided into two groups, of which one passed with Field to the King’s,
while the other remained with his late fellows and was ultimately left
with Christopher Beeston when their occupation of the Cockpit ended in
1625.</p>

<p>I classify the plays dealt with in these notes as follows: (<i>a</i>)
Plays wholly or substantially by Beaumont&mdash;<i>The Woman Hater</i>,
<i>The Knight of the Burning Pestle</i>; (<i>b</i>) Plays of the
Beaumont-Fletcher collaboration&mdash;<i>Philaster</i>, <i>A Maid’s
Tragedy</i>, <i>A King and No King</i>, <i>Four Plays in One</i>,
<i>Cupid’s Revenge</i>, <i>The Coxcomb</i>, <i>The Scornful Lady</i>;
(<i>c</i>) Plays wholly or substantially by Fletcher&mdash;<i>The Woman’s
Prize</i>, <i>The Faithful Shepherdess</i>, <i>Monsieur Thomas</i>,
<i>Valentinian</i>, <i>Bonduca</i>, <i>Wit Without Money</i>;
(<i>d</i>) Plays of doubtful authorship and, in some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span> cases,
period&mdash;<i>The Captain</i>, <i>The Honest Man’s Fortune</i>, <i>The
Two Noble Kinsmen</i>, <i>The Faithful Friends</i>, <i>Thierry and
Theodoret</i>, <i>Wit at Several Weapons</i>, <i>Love’s Cure</i>,
<i>The Night Walker</i>. Full treatment of <i>The Two Noble
Kinsmen</i>, as of <i>Henry VIII</i>, in which Fletcher certainly
had a hand, is only possible in relation to Shakespeare. I have not
thought it necessary to include every play which, or a hypothetical
version of which, an unsupported conjecture, generally from Mr.
Oliphant, puts earlier than 1616. <i>The Queen of Corinth</i>, <i>The
Noble Gentleman</i>, <i>The Little French Lawyer</i>, <i>The Laws of
Candy</i>, <i>The Knight of Malta</i>, <i>The Fair Maid of the Inn</i>,
<i>The Chances</i>, <i>Beggar’s Bush</i>, <i>The Bloody Brother</i>,
<i>Love’s Pilgrimage</i>, <i>Nice Valour</i>, and <i>Rule a Wife and
Have a Wife</i> are omitted on this principle, and I believe I might
safely have extended the same treatment to some of those in my class
(<i>d</i>).</p>

<p>Fleay, i. 177, and Gayley, 73, put the date in the spring of 1607,
finding a reference in ‘a favourite on the sudden’ (<span class="allsmcap">I.</span> iii)
to the success of Robert Carr in taking the fancy of James at the
tilt of 24 March 1607, to which Fleay adds that ‘another inundation’
(<span class="allsmcap">III.</span> i) recalls a flood of 20 Jan. 1607. Neither argument
is convincing, and it is not known that the Paul’s boys went on into
1607; they are last heard of in July 1606. The prologue expresses
the author’s intention not to lose his ears, perhaps an allusion to
Jonson’s and Chapman’s peril after <i>Eastward Ho!</i> in 1605. Gayley
notes in <span class="allsmcap">II.</span> iii what certainly looks like a reminiscence of
<i>Antony and Cleopatra</i>, <span class="allsmcap">IV.</span> xiv. 51 and xv. 87, but it is
no easier to be precise about the date of <i>Antony and Cleopatra</i>
than about that of <i>The Woman Hater</i>. The play is universally
regarded as substantially Beaumont’s and the original prologue only
speaks of a single author, but Davenant in 1649 evidently supposed
it to be Fletcher’s, saying ‘full twenty yeares, he wore the bayes’.

<p>The Epistle tells us that the play was ‘in eight daies ... begot and
borne’, ‘exposed to the wide world, who ... utterly reiected it’,
preserved by Keysar and sent to Burre, who had ‘fostred it priuately
in my bosome these two yeares’. The play ‘hopes his father will beget
him a yonger brother’. Burre adds, ‘Perhaps it will be thought to bee
of the race of Don Quixote: we both may confidently sweare, it is his
elder aboue a yeare’. The references to the actors in the induction as
boys and the known connexion of Keysar with the Queen’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span> Revels fix the
company. The date is more difficult. It cannot be earlier than 1607,
since the reference to a play at the Red Bull in which the Sophy of
Persia christens a child (<span class="allsmcap">IV.</span> i. 46) is to Day’s <i>Travels
of Three English Brothers</i> of that year. With other allusions, not
in themselves conclusive, 1607 would agree well enough, notably with
Ind. 8, ‘This seuen yeares there hath beene playes at this house’, for
it was just seven years in the autumn of 1607 since Evans set up plays
at the Blackfriars. The trouble is <span class="allsmcap">IV.</span> i. 73, ‘Read the play
of the <i>Foure Prentices of London</i>, where they tosse their pikes
so’, for this implies that the <i>Four Prentices</i> was not merely
produced but in print, and the earliest extant edition is of 1615. It
is, however, quite possible that the play may have been in print, even
as far back as 1594 (cf. s.v. Heywood). Others put it, and with it the
<i>K. B. P.</i>, in 1610, in which case the production would have been
at the Whitefriars, the history of which can only be traced back two
or three years and not seven years before 1610. On the whole, I think
the reference to <i>Don Quixote</i> in the Epistle is in favour of
1607 rather than 1610. It is, of course, conceivable that Burre only
meant to claim that the <i>K. B. P.</i> was a year older than Thomas
Shelton’s translation of <i>Don Quixote</i>, which was entered in
<i>S. R.</i> on 19 Jan. 1611 and published in 1612. Even this brings
us back to the very beginning of 1610, and the boast would have been a
fairly idle one, as Shelton states in his preface that the translation
was actually made ‘some five or six yeares agoe’. Shelton’s editor,
Mr. Fitzmaurice-Kelly, has shown that it was based on the Brussels
edition of 1607. If we put it in 1608 and the <i>K. B. P.</i> in 1607
the year’s priority of the latter is preserved. Most certainly the
<i>K. B. P.</i> was not prior to the Spanish <i>Don Quixote</i> of
1605. Its dependence on Cervantes is not such as necessarily to imply
that Beaumont had read the romance, but he had certainly heard of its
general drift and of the particular episodes of the inn taken for a
castle and the barber’s basin. Fleay, Boyle, Moorman, Murch, and Alden
are inclined to assign to Fletcher some or all of the scenes in which
Jasper and Luce and Humphrey take part; but Macaulay, Oliphant and
Gayley regard the play, except perhaps for a touch or two, as wholly
Beaumont’s. Certainly the Epistle suggests that the play had but one
‘father’.</p>

<p>Jonson told Drummond in the winter of 1618–19 (Laing, 17) that
‘Flesher and Beaumont, ten yeers since, hath written the Faithfull
Shipheardesse, a Tragicomedie, well done’. This gives us the date
1608–9, which there is nothing to contradict. The undated Q<sub>1</sub> may
be put in 1609 or 1610, as Skipwith died on 3 May 1610 and the short
partnership of the publishers is traceable from 22 Dec. 1608 to 14 Jan.
1610. It is, moreover, in Sir John Harington’s catalogue of his plays,
which was made up in 1609 or 1610 (cf. ch. xxii). The presence of
Field, Chapman, and Jonson amongst the verse-writers and the mentions
in Beaumont’s verses of ‘the waxlights’ and of a boy dancing between
the acts point to the Queen’s Revels as the producers. It is clear also
from the verses that the play was damned, and that Fletcher alone, in
spite of Drummond’s report, was the author. This is not doubted on
internal grounds.</p>

<p>Fleay, i. 198, Oliphant, and Thorndike, 70, accumulate inconclusive
evidence bearing on the date, of which the most that can be said is
that an answer to <i>The Taming of the Shrew</i> would have more point
the nearer it came to the date of the original, and that the references
to the siege of Ostend in <span class="allsmcap">I.</span> iii would be topical during or
not long after that siege, which ended on 8 Sept. 1604. On the other
hand, Gayley (<i>R. E. C.</i> iii, lxvi) calls attention to possible
reminiscences of <i>Epicoene</i> (<i>1609</i>) and <i>Alchemist</i>
(<i>1610</i>). I see no justification for supposing that a play written
in 1605 would undergo revision, as has been suggested, in 1610–14.
A revival by the King’s in 1633 got them into some trouble with
Sir Henry Herbert, who claimed the right to purge even an old play
of ‘oaths, prophaness, and ribaldrye’ (<i>Variorum</i>, iii. 208).
Possibly the play is also <i>The Woman is too Hard for Him</i>, which
the King’s took to Court on 26 Nov. 1621 (Murray, ii. 193). But the
original writing was not necessarily for this company. There is general
agreement in assigning the play to Fletcher alone.</p>

<p class="p-left">If so, the date 1608–10 is suggested, and I do not think
that it is possible to be more precise. No trustworthy argument can
be based with Gayley, 342, on the fact that Davies’s epigram follows
that praising Ostler as ‘Roscius’ and ‘sole king of actors’; and I fear
that the view of Thorndike, 65, that 1608 is a ‘probable’ conjecture is
biased by a desire to assume priority to <i>Cymbeline</i>. There were
two Court performances in the winter of 1612–13, and Fleay, i. 189,
suggests that the versions of <span class="allsmcap">I.</span> i and <span class="allsmcap">V.</span> iv, v which
appear in Q<sub>1</sub> were made for these. The epistle to Q<sub>2</sub> describes
them as ‘dangerous and gaping wounds ... received in the first
impression’. There is general agreement that most of the play, whether
Davies knew it or not, is Beaumont’s. Most critics assign <span class="allsmcap">V.</span>

<p>The play was given at Court by the Queen’s Revels on 2 or 3 Nov.
1612. It passed, doubtless, through the Lady Elizabeth’s, to whom the
actor-list probably belongs, to the King’s, who took it to Court on 5
March 1622 (Murray, ii. 193) and again on 17 Nov. 1636 (Cunningham,
xxiv). There was thus more than one opportunity for the prologue, which
speaks of the play as having a mixed reception at first, partly because
of its length, then ‘long forgot’, and now revived<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span> and shortened. The
original date may be between the issue in 1608 of Baudouin’s French
translation of <i>The Curious Impertinent</i> from <i>Don Quixote</i>,
which in original or translation suggested its plot, and Jonson’s
<i>Alchemist</i> (1610), <span class="allsmcap">IV.</span> vii. 39, ‘You are ... a Don

ii to Beaumont and the rest to Fletcher. Fleay, Boyle, Oliphant, and

<p>The play must have been known by 31 Oct. 1611 when Buck named the
<i>Second Maiden’s Tragedy</i> (q.v.) after it, and it was given
at Court during 1612–13. An inferior limit is not attainable and
any date within <i>c.</i> 1608–11 is possible. Gayley, 349, asks us
to accept the play as more mature than, and therefore later than,
<i>Philaster</i>. Fleay, i. 192, thinks that the mask in <span class="allsmcap">I.</span>
ii was added after the floods in the winter of 1612, but you cannot
bring Neptune into a mask without mention of floods. As to authorship
there is some division of opinion, especially on <span class="allsmcap">II.</span> ii
and <span class="allsmcap">IV.</span> iii; subject thereto, a balance of opinion gives
<span class="allsmcap">I</span>, <span class="allsmcap">II</span>, <span class="allsmcap">III</span>, <span class="allsmcap">IV.</span> ii, iv and
<span class="allsmcap">V.</span> iv to Beaumont, and only <span class="allsmcap">IV.</span> i and <span class="allsmcap">V.</span> i,
ii, iii to Fletcher.</p>

<p>An episode (<span class="allsmcap">I.</span> ii) consists of a mask at the wedding of
Amintor and Evadne, with an introductory dialogue between Calianax,
Diagoras, who keeps the doors, and guests desiring admission. ‘The
ladies are all placed above,’ says Diagoras, ‘save those that come in
the King’s troop.’ Calianax has an ‘office’, evidently as Chamberlain.
‘He would run raging among them, and break a dozen wiser heads than his
own in the twinkling of an eye.’</p>

<p>The maskers are Proteus and other sea-gods; the presenters Night,
Cinthia, Neptune, Aeolus, Favonius, and other winds, who ‘rise’ or come
‘out of a rock’. There are two ‘measures’ between hymeneal songs, but
no mention of taking out ladies.</p>

<p>In an earlier passage (<span class="allsmcap">I.</span> i. 9) a poet says of masks, ‘They
must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span> commend their King, and speak in praise Of the Assembly, bless
the Bride and Bridegroom, In person of some God; th’are tyed to rules

<p>This is a fixed point, both for date and authorship, in the history
of the collaboration. Herbert records (<i>Var.</i> iii. 263) that
it was ‘allowed to be acted in 1611’ by Sir George Buck. It was in
fact acted at Court by the King’s on 26 Dec. 1611 and again during
1612–13. A performance at Hampton Court on 10 Jan. 1637 is also
upon record (Cunningham, xxv). The epistle, which tells us that the
publisher received the play from Nevill, speaks of ‘the authors’ and of
their ‘future labours’; rather oddly, as Beaumont was dead. There is
practical unanimity in assigning <span class="allsmcap">I</span>, <span class="allsmcap">II</span>, <span class="allsmcap">III</span>,

<p>The play was given by the Queen’s Revels at Court on 5 Jan. 1612, 1
Jan. 1613, and either 9 Jan. or 27 Feb. 1613. It was revived by the
Lady Elizabeth’s at Court on 28 Dec. 1624, and is in the Cockpit list
of 1639. It cannot therefore be later than 1611–12, while no close
inferior limit can be fixed. Fleay, i. 187, argues that it has been
altered for Court, chiefly by turning a wicked king, queen, and prince
into a duke, duchess, and marquis. I doubt if this implies revision
as distinct from censorship, and in any case it does not, as Fleay
suggests, imply the intervention of a reviser other than the original
authors. The suggestion has led to chaos in the distribution of
authorship, since various critics have introduced Daborne, Field, and
Massinger as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span> possible collaborators or revisers. The stationer speaks
of a single ‘author’, meaning Fletcher, but says he was ‘not acquainted
with him’. And the critics at least agree in finding both Beaumont and
Fletcher, pretty well throughout.</p>

<p>The play was given by the King’s at Court during 1612–13, and
presumably falls between that date and the admission of Ostler to the
company in 1609. The 1679 print, by a confusion, gives the scene as
‘Venice, Spain’, but this hardly justifies the suggestion of Fleay, i.
195, that we have a version of Fletcher’s work altered for the Court
by Barnes. He had formerly conjectured collaboration between Fletcher
and Jonson (<i>E. S.</i> ix. 18). The prologue speaks of ‘the author’;
Fleay thinks that the mention of ‘twelve pence’ as the price of a seat
indicates a revival. Several critics find Massinger; Oliphant finds
Rowley; and Boyle and Oliphant find Beaumont, as did Macaulay, 196, in
1883, but apparently not in 1910 (<i>C. H.</i> vi. 137).</p>

<p>On the fly-leaf of the MS. is ‘The Honest Man’s Fortune, Plaide in the
yeare 1613’, and in another hand at the end of the text, ‘This Play,
being an olde one, and the Originall lost was reallow’d by mee this 8
Febru. 1624. Att the intreaty of Mr. &emsp;&emsp;.’ The last word
is torn off, but a third hand has added ‘Taylor’. The MS. contains
some alterations, partly by the licenser, partly by the stage-manager
or prompter. The latter include the names of three actors, ‘G[eorge]
Ver[non]’, ‘J: R Cro’ and ‘G. Rick’. The ending of the last scene in
the MS. differs from that of the Ff. The endorsement is confirmed
by Herbert’s entry in his diary (<i>Variorum</i>, iii. 229), ‘For
the King’s company. An olde play called The Honest Mans Fortune, the
originall being lost, was re-allowed by mee at M<sup>r</sup>. Taylor’s intreaty,
and on condition to give mee a booke [The Arcadia], this 8 Februa.
1624.’ The actor-list suggests that the original performers were Lady
Elizabeth’s men, after the Queen’s Revels had joined them in March
1613. Fleay, i. 196, suggests that this is the play by Fletcher, Field,
Massinger, and Daborne which is the subject of some of Henslowe’s
correspondence and was finally delivered on 5 Aug. 1613 (Greg,
<i>Henslowe Papers</i>, 65, 90). Attempts to combine this indication
with stylistic evidence have led the critics to some agreement that
Fletcher is only responsible for <span class="allsmcap">V</span> and that Massinger is to be
found in <span class="allsmcap">III</span>, and for the rest into a quagmire of conjecture
amongst the names of Beaumont, Fletcher, Massinger, Field, Daborne,
Tourneur, and Cartwright. The appended verses of the Ff. are not in the
<i>Dyce MS.</i>, but they are in <i>Addl. MS.</i> 25707, f. 66, and

<p>The actor-list is of the King’s men between 1609–11 or between

<span class="allsmcap">II.</span> i and <span class="allsmcap">IV.</span> iv hardly justifies Oliphant’s theory

Fletcher’s Monsieur Thomas</i> (1907, <i>Anglia</i>, xxx. 89).</p>

<p>The title-page printed at the time of the revival by the King’s men
of the Restoration enables us to identify <i>Monsieur Thomas</i> with
the <i>Father’s Own Son</i> of the Cockpit repertory in 1639, and like
the other plays of the Beaumont and Fletcher series in that repertory
it was probably written by 1616, and either for the Queen’s Revels or
for the Lady Elizabeth’s. An allusion in <span class="allsmcap">II.</span> iii. 104 to ‘all
the feathers in the Friars’ might indicate production at Porter’s Hall
in the Blackfriars about that year. The play cannot be earlier than
its source, Part ii (1610) of H. d’Urfé’s <i>Astrée</i>, and by 1610
the more permanent Blackfriars house had passed to the King’s, by whom
the performances referred to on the original title-page must therefore
have been given. Perhaps the explanation is that there had been some
misunderstanding about the distribution of the Lady Elizabeth’s men’s
plays between the King’s and the Cockpit, and that a revival by the
King’s in 1639 led the Cockpit managers to get the Lord Chamberlain’s
order of 10 Aug. 1639 (<i>Variorum</i>, iii. 159) appropriating their
repertory to them. The authorship is ascribed with general assent to
Fletcher alone.</p>

production not long after the latter date. There is general agreement
in assigning the play to Fletcher alone. It passed into the Cockpit
repertory and was played there both by Queen Henrietta’s men and in
1637 by Beeston’s boys (<i>Variorum</i>, iii. 159, 239). Probably,
therefore, it was written for the Lady Elizabeth’s.</p>

<p>References to ‘talk of the Cleve wars’ (<span class="allsmcap">V.</span> iii. 66) and
‘some cast Cleve captain’ (<span class="allsmcap">V.</span> iv. 54) cannot be earlier than
1609 when the wars broke out after the death of the Duke of Cleves on
25 March, and there can hardly have been ‘cast’ captains until some
time after July 1610 when English troops first took part. Fleay, i.
181, calls attention to an allusion to the binding by itself of the
Apocrypha (<span class="allsmcap">I.</span> ii. 46) which was discussed for the A. V. and
the Douay Version, both completed in 1610; and Gayley to a reminiscence
(<span class="allsmcap">IV.</span> i. 341)<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span> of <i>Epicoene</i> which, however, was acted
in 1609, not, as Gayley thinks, 1610. None of these indications,
however, are of much importance in view of another traced by Gayley

<p class="p-left">Don Diego Sarmiento’s negotiations for a Spanish match with Prince
Charles began on 27 May 1613. The play must therefore be 1613–16. In
any case the ‘Blackfriars’ of the title-page must be the Porter’s Hall
house of 1615–17. Even if the end of 1609 were a possible date, Murray,
i. 153, is wrong in supposing that the Revels were then at Blackfriars.
There is fair unanimity in assigning <span class="allsmcap">I</span>, the whole or part of
<span class="allsmcap">II</span>, and <span class="allsmcap">V.</span> ii to Beaumont, and the rest to Fletcher,

<p>Fleay, i. 205, dates the play <i>c.</i> 1617, supposing it to be a
satire on the French Court, and the name De Vitry to be that of the
slayer of the Maréchal d’Ancre. Thorndike, 79, has little difficulty
in disposing of this theory, although it may be pointed out that the
Privy Council did in fact intervene to suppress a play about the
Maréchal in 1617 (Gildersleeve, 113); but he is less successful in
attempting to show any special plausibility in a date as early as 1607.
A former conjecture by Fleay (<i>E. S.</i> ix. 21) that <span class="allsmcap">III</span>
and <span class="allsmcap">V.</span> i are fragments of the anonymous <i>Branholt</i> of the
Admiral’s in 1597 may also be dismissed with Greg (<i>Henslowe</i>,
ii. 188). Most critics find, in addition to Fletcher, Massinger, as
collaborator or reviser, according to the date given to the play, and
some add Field or Daborne. Oliphant and Thorndike find Beaumont. So did
Macaulay, 196, in 1883, but apparently not in 1910 (<i>C. H.</i> vi.
138).</p>

on 11 May 1633 and it was played at Court by Queen Henrietta’s men on
30 Jan. 1634 (<i>Variorum</i>, iii. 236). The only justification for
placing Fletcher’s version earlier than 1616 is the suspicion that
the only plays of Beaumont or Fletcher which passed to the Cockpit
repertory were some of those written for the Queen’s Revels or the Lady
Elizabeth’s before that date.</p>

(<i>T. L. S.</i> 11 Dec. 1919).</p>

<p>This does not seem to have passed to the King’s men or the Cockpit, and
cannot be assigned to any particular company. It has been supposed to
be a boys’ play, presumably because it has much music and dancing. It
has also much pageantry in dumb-shows and so forth and stage machinery.
Conceivably it might have been written for private performance in place
of a mask. <i>Time</i>, in particular, has much the form of a mask,
with antimask. But composite plays of this type were well known on the
public stage. There is no clear indication of date. Fleay, i. 179,
suggested 1608 because <i>The Yorkshire Tragedy</i>, printed that year,
is also described in its heading as ‘one of the Four Plays in One’, but
presumably it belonged to another series. Thorndike, 85, points out
that the antimask established itself in Court masks in 1608. Gayley,
301, puts <i>Death</i> and <i>Time</i> in 1610, because he thinks
that they fall stylistically between <i>The Faithfull Shepherdess</i>
and <i>Philaster</i>, and the rest in 1612, because he thinks they
are Field’s and that they cannot be before 1611, since they are not
mentioned, like <i>Amends for Ladies</i>, as forthcoming in the
epistle to <i>Woman a Weathercock</i> in that year. This hardly bears
analysis, and indeed Field is regarded as the author of the Induction
and <i>Honour</i> only by Oliphant and Gayley and of <i>Love</i> only
by Gayley himself. All these are generally assigned to Beaumont, and
<i>Death</i> and <i>Time</i> universally to Fletcher. Lawrence’s
attempt to attach the piece to the wedding festivities of 1612–13 does
not seem to me at all convincing.</p>

<p>The prologue, evidently later than Fletcher’s death in 1625, clearly
assigns the authorship to Beaumont and Fletcher, although the epilogue,
of uncertain date, speaks of ‘our author’. This is the only sound
reason for thinking that the original composition was in Beaumont’s
lifetime. The internal evidence for an early date cited<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span> by Fleay, i.
180, and Thorndike, 72, becomes trivial when we eliminate what merely
fixes the historic time of the play to 1604–9, and proves nothing as to
the time of composition. On the other hand, <span class="allsmcap">II.</span> ii,</p>

<p class="p-left">points to a date later than the winter of 1621, as I
cannot trace any earlier great frost in which a Muscovite embassy can
have been in London (<i>S. P. D. Jac. I</i>, cxxiii, 11, 100; cxxiv.
40). Further, the critics seem confident that the dominant hand in
the play as it exists is Massinger’s, and that Beaumont and Fletcher
show, if at all, faintly through his revision. The play belonged to the
repertory of the King’s men by 1641 (<i>M. S. C.</i> i. 364).</p>

<p>The history of the play is very obscure. It is neither in the Cockpit
repertory of 1639 nor in that of the King’s in 1641, and the guesses of
Fleay, i. 218, that it may be <i>The Devil of Dowgate or Usury Put to
Use</i>, licensed by Herbert for the King’s on 17 Oct. 1623, and <i>The
Buck is a Thief</i>, played at Court by the same men on 28 Dec. 1623,
are unsupported and mutually destructive. The epilogue, clearly written
after the death of Fletcher, tells us that ‘’twas well receiv’d before’
and that Fletcher ‘had to do in’ it, and goes on to qualify this by
adding&mdash;</p>

<p class="p-left">The critics find varying amounts of Fletcher, with
work of other hands, which some of them venture to identify as those
of Middleton and Rowley. Oliphant, followed by Thorndike, 87, finds
Beaumont, and the latter points to allusions which are not inconsistent
with, but certainly do not prove, 1609–10, or even an earlier date.
Macaulay, 196, also found Beaumont in 1883, but seems to have retired
upon Middleton and Rowley in 1910 (<i>C. H.</i> vi. 138).</p>

<p>Fleay in 1889 (<i>E. S.</i> xiii. 32) saw evidence of a date in 1614
in certain possible allusions (<span class="allsmcap">I.</span> i. 45–52, 123–6) to the
Earl of Somerset and his wedding on 26 Dec. 1613, and suggested Field
and Daborne as the authors. In 1891 (i. 81, 201) he gave the whole to
Daborne, except <span class="allsmcap">IV.</span> v, which he thought of later date, and
supposed it to be the subject of Daborne’s letter of 11 March 1614 to
Henslowe, which was in fact probably <i>The Owl</i> (Greg, <i>Henslowe
Papers</i>, 82). Oliphant thinks it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span> a revision by Massinger and Field
in 1614 of a play by Beaumont and Fletcher, perhaps as early as 1604.
With this exception no critic seems much to believe in the presence of
Beaumont or Fletcher, and Boyle, who suggests Shirley, points out that
the allusion in <span class="allsmcap">I.</span> i. 124 to the relation between Philip III
and the Duke of Lerma as in the past would come more naturally after
Philip’s death in 1621 or at least after Lerma’s disgrace in 1618. The
MS. is in various hands, one of which has made corrections. Some of
these seem on internal evidence to have been due to suggestions of the
censor, others to play-house exigencies.</p>

<p>For general notices of the wedding masks, see ch. xxiv and the account

in the <i>Mercure François</i> gives a very inaccurate description of
Beaumont’s work as left to us, introducing an Atlas and an Aletheia who
find no places in the text.</p>

<p>The maskers, in carnation, were fifteen knights of Olympia; the
musicians twelve priests of Jove; the presenters Mercury and Iris.
There were two antimasks, Mercury’s of four Naiads, five Hyades, four
Cupids, and four Statues, ‘not of one kinde or liverie (because<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
that had been so much in use heretofore)’, and Iris’s of a ‘rurall
company’ consisting of a Pedant, a May Lord and Lady, a Servingman and
Chambermaid, a Country Clown or Shepherd and Country Wench, a Host
and Hostess, a He Baboon and She Baboon, and a He Fool and She Fool
‘ushering them in’.</p>

<p>The locality was the Banqueting House at Whitehall. The Hall was
originally appointed, and on Shrove-Tuesday, 16 Feb., the mask came
by water from Winchester House in the royal barge, attended by many
gentlemen of the Inns in other barges. They landed at the Privy Stairs,
watched by the King and princes from the Privy Gallery, and were
conducted to the Vestry. But the actual mask was put off until 20 Feb.,
in view of the press in the Hall, and then given in Banqueting House.
Beaumont’s description passes lightly over this <i>contretemps</i>, but
cf. <i>infra</i>.</p>

<p>The ‘fabricke’ was a mountain, with separate ‘traverses’ discovering
its lower and its higher slopes. From the former issued the presenters
and antimasks, whose ‘measures’ were both encored by the King, but
unluckily ‘one of the Statuaes by that time was undressed’. The latter
bore the ‘maine masque’ in two pavilions before the altar of Jupiter.
The maskers descended, danced two measures, then took their ladies to
dance galliards, durets, corantoes, &amp;c., then danced ‘their parting
measure’ and ascended.</p>

<p>Phineas Pett, Master of the Shipwrights’ Company in 1613, relates
(<i>Archaeologia</i>, xii. 266) that he was</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="p-left">‘intreated by divers gentlemen of the inns of business, whereof
Sir Francis Bacon was chief, to attend the bringing of a mask
by water in the night from St. Mary Over’s to Whitehall in some
of the gallies; but the tide falling out very contrary and the
company attending the maskers very unruly, the project could not
be performed so exactly as was purposed and expected. But yet
they were safely landed at the plying stairs at Whitehall, for
which my paines the gentlemen gave me a fair recompence.’</p>
</div>

<p>Chamberlain (Birch, i. 227) says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="p-left">‘On Tuesday it came to Gray’s Inn and the Inner Temple’s turn to
come with their mask, whereof Sir Francis Bacon was the chief
contriver; and because the former came on horseback and in open
chariots, they made choice to come by water from Winchester
Place, in Southwark, which suited well with their device, which
was the marriage of the river of Thames to the Rhine; and their
show by water was very gallant, by reason of infinite store
of lights, very curiously set and placed, and many boats and
barges, with devices of light and lamps, with three peals of
ordnance, one at their taking water, another in the Temple
garden, and the last at their landing; which passage by water
cost them better than three hundred pounds. They were received
at the Privy Stairs, and great expectation there was that they
should every way excel their competitors that went before them;
both in device, daintiness of apparel, and, above all, in
dancing, wherein they are held excellent, and esteemed for the
properer men. But by what ill planet it fell out, I know not,
they came home as they went, without doing anything; the reason
whereof I cannot yet learn thoroughly, but only that the hall
was so full that it was not possible to avoid it, or make room
for them; besides that, most of the ladies were in the galleries
to see them land, and could not get in.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span></p>

<p class="p-left">But the worst of all was, that the King was so wearied and
sleepy, with sitting up almost two whole nights before, that he
had no edge to it. Whereupon, Sir Francis Bacon adventured to
entreat of his majesty that by this difference he would not, as
it were, bury them quick; and I hear the King should answer,
that then they must bury him quick, for he could last no longer,
but withal gave them very good words, and appointed them to come
again on Saturday. But the grace of their mask is quite gone,
when their apparel hath been already showed, and their devices
vented, so that how it will fall out God knows, for they are
much discouraged and out of countenance, and the world says it
comes to pass after the old proverb, the properer man the worse
luck.’</p>
</div>

<p class="p-left">In a later letter (Birch, i. 229) Chamberlain concludes
the story:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="p-left">‘And our Gray’s Inn men and the Inner Templars were nothing
discouraged, for all the first dodge, but on Saturday last
performed their parts exceeding well and with great applause and
approbation, both from the King and all the company.’</p>
</div>

<p class="p-left">In a third letter, to Winwood (iii, 435), he describes
the adventures of the mask more briefly, and adds the detail that the
performance was</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="p-left">‘in the new bankquetting house, which for a kind of amends was
granted to them, though with much repining and contradiction of
their emulators.’</p>
</div>

<p class="p-left">Chamberlain refers to the ‘new’ room of 1607, and not
to that just put up for the wedding. This was used for the banquet.
Foscarini reports (<i>V. P.</i> xii. 532) that:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="p-left">‘After the ballet was over their Majesties and their Highnesses
passed into a great Hall especially built for the purpose, where
were long tables laden with comfits and thousands of mottoes.
After the King had made the round of the tables, everything was
in a moment rapaciously swept away.’</p>
</div>

<p>The records of the Inns throw light on the finance and organization
of the mask. From those of the Inner Temple (Inderwick, ii. 72, 76,
81, 92, 99) we learn that the Inn’s share of the cost was ‘not so
little as 1200<sup>li</sup>’, that there were payments to Lewis Hele, Nicholas
Polhill, and Fenner, and for ‘scarlet for the marshal of the mask’,
that there was a rehearsal for the benchers at Ely House, and that
funds were raised up to 1616 by assessments of £2 and £1 and by
assigning the revenue derived from admission fees to chambers. Those
of Gray’s Inn (Fletcher, 201–8) contain an order for such things to
be bought ‘as M<sup>r</sup>. Solicitor [Bacon] shall thinke fitt’. One Will
Gerrard was appointed Treasurer, and an assessment of from £1 to £4
according to status was to be made for a sum equal to that raised by
the Inner Temple. There was evidently some difficulty in liquidating
the bills. In May 1613 an order was made ‘that the gent. late actors in
the maske at the court shall bring in all ther masking apparrel w<sup>ch</sup>
they had of the howse charge ... or else the value therof’. In June a
further order was drafted and then stayed, calling attention to the
‘sad contempts’ of those affected by the former, ‘albeit none of them
did contribute anything to the charge’. Each suit had cost 100 marks.
The offenders were to be discommonsed. In November and again in the
following February it was found necessary to appropriate admission fees
towards the debt.</p>

<p>There are small bits of evidence, in the use of Danish names from
<i>Hamlet</i> and other Elizabethan plays, and in a jest on ‘Mondays
vein to poetize’ (l. 548), to suggest a date of composition long before
that of publication, but a borrowing from <i>The Knight of the Burning
Pestle</i> makes it improbable that this can be earlier than 1607.
The amount of Newcastle local colour and a special mention of ‘those
Players of Interludes that dwels at <i>Newcastle</i>’ (l. 534) led
Fleay, i. 34, to conjecture that it was acted in that town.</p>

<p>Anthony Brewer has been confused with Thomas Brewer, or perhaps with
more than one writer of that name, who wrote various works of popular
literature, and to whom yet others bearing only the initials T. B.
are credited, between 1608 and 1656. Thus <i>The Country Girl</i>,
printed as by T. B. in 1647, is ascribed in Kirkman’s play-lists of
1661 and 1671 to Antony Brewer, but in Archer’s list of 1656 to Thomas.
Oliphant (<i>M. P.</i> viii. 422) points out that the scene is in part
at Edmonton, and thinks it a revision by Massinger of an early work by
Thomas, who published a pamphlet entitled <i>The Life and Death of the
Merry Devil of Edmonton</i> in 1608.</p>

consideration of certain plays and shows at Christmas last set forth
by him’ (Inderwick, <i>Inner Temple Records</i>, i. 219). Possibly
he refers to one of these plays when he says in the epistle to his
<i>Romeus and Juliet</i> (1562), ‘I saw the same argument lately set
foorth on stage with more commendation then I can looke for: (being
there much better set forth then I have or can dooe)’; but if so, he

<p>The maskers, in green and white, were Knights; the first antimaskers,
with an ‘antic measure’, two Actaeons, two Midases, two Lycaons, two

Maids of Circe and three Nereids; the musicians Sirens, Echoes, a

<p>The locality was the hall of the Inner Temple. Towards the lower end
was discovered a sea-cliff. The drawing of a traverse discovered a
wood, in which later two gates flew open, disclosing the maskers asleep
in an arbour at the end of a glade. Awaked by a charm, they danced
their first and second measures, took out ladies for ‘the old measures,
galliards, corantoes, the brawls, etc.’, and danced their last measure.</p>

<p class="p-left p2">JAMES CALFHILL (1530?-1570).</p>

<p>Calfhill was an Eton and King’s College, Cambridge, man, who migrated
to Oxford and became Student of Christ Church in 1548 and Canon in
1560. He was in Orders and was Rector of West Horsley when Elizabeth
was there in 1559. After various preferments, he was nominated Bishop
of Worcester in 1570, but died before consecration.</p>

<p>On 6 July 1564 Walter Haddon wrote to Abp. Parker (<i>Parker
Correspondence</i>, 218) deprecating the tone of a sermon by Calfhill
before the Queen, and said ‘Nunquam in illo loco quisquam minus
satisfecit, quod maiorem ex eo dolorem omnibus attulit, quoniam admodum
est illis artibus instructus quas illius theatri celebritas postulat’.
No play by Calfhill is extant, but his Latin tragedy of <i>Progne</i>
was given before Elizabeth at Christ Church on 5 Sept. 1566 (cf. ch.
iv), and appears from Bereblock’s synopsis to have been based on an
earlier Latin <i>Progne</i> (1558) by Gregorio Corraro.</p>


<p class="p-left p2">THOMAS CAMPION (1567–1620).</p>

<p>Thomas, son of John Campion, a Chancery clerk of Herts. extraction,
was born on 12 Feb. 1567, educated at Peterhouse, Cambridge, where he
took no degree, and admitted on 27 April 1586 to Gray’s Inn, where
he took part as Hidaspis and Melancholy in the comedy of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span> 16 Jan.
1588 (cf. ch. vii). He left the law, and probably served in Essex’s
expedition of 1591 to France. He first appeared as a poet, anonymously,
in the appendix to Sidney’s <i>Astrophel and Stella</i> (1591), and
has left several books of songs written as airs for music, often of
his own composition, as well as a collection of Latin epigrams and
<i>Observations in the Art of English Poesie</i> (1602). I do not know
whether he can be the ‘Campnies’ who performed at the Gray’s Inn mask
of Shrovetide 1595 at Court (cf. s.v. <i>Gesta Grayorum</i>), but one
of the two hymns in that mask, <i>A Hymn in Praise of Neptune</i> is
assigned to him by Francis Davison, <i>Poetical Rhapsody</i> (1602),
sig. K 8, and it is possible that the second hymn, beginning ‘Shadows
before the shining sun do vanish’, which Davison does not himself
appear to claim, may also be his. By 1607 he had taken the degree
of M.D., probably abroad, and he practised as a physician. Through
Sir Thomas Monson he was entangled, although in no very blameworthy
capacity, in the Somerset scandals of 1613–15. On 1 March 1620 he died,
probably of the plague, naming as his legatee Philip Rosseter, with
whom he had written <i>A Booke of Airs</i> in 1601.</p>

<p>Campion is not traceable as a writer for the stage, although his
connexion with Monson and Rosseter would have made it not surprising
to find him concerned with the Queen’s Revels syndicate of 1610. But
his contribution to the <i>Gesta Grayorum</i> foreshadowed his place,
second only to Jonson’s, who wrote a <i>Discourse of Poesie</i> (Laing,
1), now lost, against him, in the mask-poetry of the Jacobean period.
In addition to his acknowledged masks he may also be responsible for
part or all of the Gray’s Inn <i>Mountebanks Mask</i> of 1618, printed
by Nichols, <i>Eliz.</i> iii. 320, as a second part of the <i>Gesta
Grayorum</i>, and by Bullen, <i>Marston</i>, iii. 417, although the
ascription to Marston is extremely improbable.</p>

Thomas Campion Doctor of Phisicke. <i>John Windet for John Browne.</i>
[Engraving of the maskers’ habit; Verses to James, Lord De Walden and
Lord and Lady Hay.]</p>

<p>The maskers, in carnation and silver, concealed at first in a ‘false
habit’ of green leaves and silver, were nine Knights of Apollo; the
torchbearers the nine Hours of Night; the presenters Flora, Zephyrus,
Night, and Hesperus; the musicians Sylvans, who, as the mask was
predominantly musical, were aided by consorts of instruments and voices
above the scene and on either side of the hall.</p>

<p>The locality was the ‘great hall’ at Whitehall. At the upper end were
the cloth and chair of state, with ‘scaffolds and seats on either side
continued to the screen’. Eighteen feet from the screen was a stage,
which stood three feet higher than the ‘dancing-place’ in front of
it, and was enclosed by a ‘double veil’ or vertically divided curtain
representing clouds. The Bower of Flora stood on the right and the
House of Night on the left at the ends of the screen, and between them
a grove, behind which, under the window, rose hills with a Tree of
Diana. In the grove were nine golden trees which performed the first
dance, and then, at the touch of Night’s wand, were drawn down by an
engine under the stage, and cleft to reveal the maskers. After two
more ‘new’ dances, they took out the ladies for ‘measures’. Then they
danced ‘their lighter dances as corantoes, levaltas and galliards’;
then a fourth ‘new’ dance; and then ‘putting off their vizards and
helmets, made a low honour to the King, and attended his Majesty to the
banqueting place’.</p>

<p>The mask was given, presumably by friends of the bridegroom, in honour
of the wedding of James Lord Hay and Honora, daughter of Lord Denny.
The maskers were Lord Walden, Sir Thomas Howard, Sir Henry Carey, Sir
Richard Preston, Sir John Ashley, Sir Thomas Jarret, Sir John Digby,
Sir Thomas Badger, and Mr. Goringe. One air for a song and one for a
song and dance were made by Campion, two for dances by Mr. Lupo, and
one for a dance by Mr. Thomas Giles.</p>

<p>Few contemporary references to the mask exist. It is probably that
described in a letter, which I have not seen, from Lady Pembroke to
Lord Shrewsbury, calendared among other <i>Talbot MSS.</i> of 1607 in
Lodge, App. 121. No ambassadors were invited&mdash;‘<i>Dieu merci</i>’&mdash;says
the French ambassador, and Anne, declaring herself ill, stayed away
(La Boderie, ii. 12, 30). Expenditure on preparing the hall appears in
the accounts of the Treasurer of the Chamber and the Office of Works
(Reyher, 520).</p>


<p class="center p1"><i>The Lords’ Mask. 14 Feb. 1613</i></p>

<p>1613. <i>For John Budge.</i> [Annexed to <i>Caversham Entertainment</i>
(q.v.).]</p>

<p>This was for the wedding of Elizabeth. The men maskers, in cloth of
silver, were eight transformed Stars, the women, also in silver,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
eight transformed Statues; the torchbearers sixteen Fiery Spirits; the
antimaskers six men and six women Frantics; the presenters Orpheus,
Mania, Entheus, Prometheus, and Sibylla.</p>

<p>The locality was the Banqueting House at Whitehall. The lower part of
the scene, when discovered, represented a wood, with the thicket of
Orpheus on the right and the cave of Mania on the left. After the ‘mad
measure’ of the antimask, the upper part of the scene was discovered
‘by the fall of a curtain’. Here, amidst clouds, were eight Stars which
danced, vanishing to give place to the eight men maskers in the House
of Prometheus. The torchbearers emerged below, and danced. The maskers
descended on a cloud, behind which the lower part of the scene was
turned to a façade with four Statues in niches. These and then a second
four were transformed to women. Then the maskers gave their ‘first new
entering dance’ and their second dance, and took out the bridal pair
and others, ‘men women, and women men’. The scene again changed to a
prospective of porticoes leading to Sibylla’s trophy, an obelisk of
Fame. A ‘song and dance triumphant’ followed, and finally the maskers’
‘last new dance’ concluded all ‘at their going out’.</p>

<p>This was a mask of lords and ladies, at the cost of the Exchequer.
The only names on record are those of the Earls of Montgomery and
Salisbury, Lord Hay, and Ann Dudley (<i>vide infra</i>). Campion notes
the ‘extraordinary industry and skill’ of Inigo Jones in ‘the whole
invention’, and particularly his ‘neat artifice’ in contriving the
‘motion’ of the Stars.</p>

<p>The wedding masks were naturally of special interest to the Court
gossips. Chamberlain wrote to Winwood (iii. 421) on 9 Jan.: ‘It is
said the Lords and Ladyes about the court have appointed a maske
upon their own charge; but I hear there is order given for £1500 to
provide one upon the King’s cost, and a £1000 for fireworks. The Inns
of Court are likewise dealt with for two masks against that time, and
mean to furnish themselves for the service.’ On 29 Jan. he added (iii.
429), ‘Great preparations here are of braverie, masks and fireworks
against the marriage.’ On 14 Jan. one G. F. Biondi informed Carleton
(<i>S. P. D. Jac. I</i>, lxxii. 12) that the Earls of Montgomery and
Salisbury and Lord Hay were practising for the wedding mask. On 20
Jan. Sir Charles Montagu wrote to Sir Edward Montagu (<i>H. M. C.
Buccleugh MSS.</i> i. 239): ‘Here is not any news stirring, only much
preparations at this wedding for masks, whereof shall be three, one of
eight lords and eight ladies, whereof my cousin Ann Dudley one, and two
from the Inner Courts, who they say will lay it on.’</p>

<p>The Lords’ mask is certainly less prominent than those of the Inns of
Court (<i>vide sub</i> Beaumont and Chapman) in the actual descriptions
of the wedding. All three are recorded in Stowe, <i>Annales</i>, 916,
in <i>Wilbraham’s Journal</i> (<i>Camden Misc.</i> x), 110, in reports
of the Venetian ambassador (<i>V. P.</i> xii. 499, 532), and in the
contemporary printed accounts of the whole ceremonies (cf. ch. xxiv).
These do not add much to the printed descriptions of the mask-writers,
on which, indeed, they are largely based. The fullest unofficial
account was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span> given by Chamberlain to Alice and Dudley Carleton in three
letters (Birch, i. 224, 229; <i>S. P. D. Jac. I</i>, lxxii. 30, 31,
48). On 18 Feb. he wrote: ‘That night [of the wedding] was the Lords’
mask, whereof I hear no great commendation, save only for riches, their
devices being long and tedious, and more like a play than a mask.’
This criticism he repeated in a letter to Winwood (iii. 435). To Alice
Carleton he added, after describing the bravery of the Inns of Court:
‘All this time there was a course taken, and so notified, that no
lady or gentlewoman should be admitted to any of these sights with a
vardingale, which was to gain the more room, and I hope may serve to
make them quite left off in time. And yet there were more scaffolds,
and more provision made for room than ever I saw, both in the hall and
banqueting room, besides a new room built to dine and dance in.’ On
25 February, when all was over, he reported: ‘Our revels and triumphs
within doors gave great contentment, being both dainty and curious
in devices and sumptuous in show, specially the inns of court, whose
two masks stood them in better than £4000, besides the gallantry and
expense of private gentlemen that were but <i>ante ambul[at]ores</i>
and went only to accompany them.... The next night [21 Feb.] the King
invited the maskers, with their assistants, to the number of forty, to
a solemn supper in the new marriage room, where they were well treated
and much graced with kissing her majesty’s hand, and every one having a
particular <i>accoglienza</i> from him. The King husbanded this matter
so well that this feast was not at his own cost, but he and his company
won it upon a wager of running at the ring, of the prince and his nine
followers, who paid £30 a man. The King, queen, prince, Palatine and
Lady Elizabeth sat at table by themselves, and the great lords and
ladies, with the maskers, above four score in all, sat at another long
table, so that there was no room for them that made the feast, but they
were fain to be lookers on, which the young Lady Rich took no great
pleasure in, to see her husband, who was one that paid, not so much
as drink for his money. The ambassadors that were at this wedding and
shows were the French, Venetian, Count Henry [of Nassau] and Caron
for the States. The Spaniard was or would be sick, and the archduke’s
ambassador being invited for the second day, made a sullen excuse; and
those that were present were not altogether so well pleased but that
I hear every one had some punctilio of disgust.’ John Finett, in a
letter of 22 Feb. to Carleton (<i>S. P. D. Jac. I</i>, lxxii. 32), says
the mask of the Lords was ‘rich and ingenious’ and those of the Inns
‘much commended’. His letter is largely taken up with the ambassadorial
troubles to which Chamberlain refers. Later he dealt with these in
<i>Philoxenis</i> (1656), 1 (cf. Sullivan, 79). The chief marfeast was
the archiducal ambassador Boiscot, who resented an invitation to the
second or third day, while in the diplomatic absence through sickness
of the Spaniard the Venetian ambassador was asked with the French for
the first day. Finett was charged with various plausible explanations.
James did not think it his business to decide questions of precedence.
It was customary to group Venice and France. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span> Venetian had brought
an extraordinary message of congratulation from his State, and had put
his retinue into royal liveries at great expense. The wedding was a
continuing feast, and all its days equally glorious. In fact, whether
at Christmas or Shrovetide, the last day was in some ways the most
honourable, and it had originally been planned to have the Lords’
mask on Shrove-Tuesday. But Boiscot could not be persuaded to accept
his invitation. The ambassadors who did attend were troublesome, at
supper, rather than at the mask. The French ambassador ‘made an offer
to precede the prince’. His wife nearly left because she was placed
below, instead of above, the Viscountesses. The Venetian claimed a
chair instead of a stool, and a place above the carver, but in vain.
His rebuff did not prevent him from speaking well of the Lords’ mask,
which he called ‘very beautiful’, specially noting the three changes of
scene.</p>

<p>Several financial documents relating to the mask are preserved (Reyher,
508, 522; Devon, 158, 164; Collier, i. 364; Hazlitt, <i>E. D. S.</i>

are given as £400, but the total charges must have been much higher.
Chamberlain (<i>vide supra</i>) spoke of £1,500 as assigned to them.

<p class="center p1"><i>The Caversham Entertainment. 27–8 April 1613</i></p>

<p>1613. A Relation of the late royall Entertainment giuen by the Right
Honorable the Lord Knowles, at Cawsome-House neere Redding: to our
most Gracious Queene, Queene Anne, in her Progresse toward the Bathe,
vpon the seuen and eight and twentie dayes of Aprill. 1613. Whereunto
is annexed the Description, Speeches and Songs of the Lords Maske,
presented in the Banquetting-house on the Marriage night of the High
and Mightie, Count Palatine, and the Royally descended the Ladie
Elizabeth. Written by Thomas Campion. <i>For John Budge.</i></p>

<p>On arrival were speeches, a song, and a dance by a Cynic, a Traveller,
two Keepers, and two Robin Hood men at the park gate; then speeches in
the lower garden by a Gardener, and a song by his man and boy; then a
concealed song in the upper garden.</p>

<p>After supper was a mask in the hall by eight ‘noble and princely
personages’ in green with vizards, accompanied by eight pages as
torchbearers, and presented by the Cynic, Traveller, Gardener, and
their ‘crew’, and Sylvanus. The maskers gave a ‘new dance’; then took
out the ladies, among whom Anne ‘vouchsafed to make herself the head
of their revels, and graciously to adorn the place with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span> her personal
dancing’; ‘much of the night being thus spent with variety of dances,
the masquers made a conclusion with a second new dance’.</p>

<p>On departure were a speech and song by the Gardeners, and presents of a
bag of linen, apron, and mantle by three country maids.</p>

<p>Chamberlain wrote of this entertainment to Winwood (iii. 454) on 6 May,
‘The King brought her on her way to Hampton Court; her next move was
to Windsor, then to Causham, a house of the Lord Knolles not far from
Reading, where she was entertained with Revells, and a gallant mask
performed by the Lord Chamberlain’s four sons, the Earl of Dorset, the
Lord North, Sir Henry Rich, and Sir Henry Carie, and at her parting
presented with a dainty coverled or quilt, a rich carrquenet, and a
curious cabinet, to the value in all of 1500<sup>l</sup>.’ He seems to have
sent a similar account in an unprinted letter of 29 April to Carleton
(<i>S. P. D. Jac. I</i>, lxxii. 120). The four sons of Lord Chamberlain
Suffolk who appear in other masks are Theophilus Lord Walden, Sir
Thomas, Sir Henry, and Sir Charles Howard.</p>


<p class="center p1"><i>Lord Somerset’s Mask [Squires]. 26 Dec. 1613</i></p>

<p>1614. The Description of a Maske: Presented in the Banqueting roome at
Whitehall, on Saint Stephens night last, At the Mariage of the Right
Honourable the Earle of Somerset: And the right noble the Lady Frances
Howard. Written by Thomas Campion. Whereunto are annexed diuers choyse
Ayres composed for this Maske that may be sung with a single voyce to
the Lute or Base-Viall. <i>E. A. for Laurence Lisle.</i></p>

<p>The maskers were twelve Disenchanted Knights; the first antimaskers
four Enchanters and Enchantresses, four Winds, four Elements, and four
Parts of the Earth; the second antimaskers twelve Skippers in red and
white; the presenters four Squires and three Destinies; the musicians
Eternity, Harmony, and a chorus of nine.</p>

<p>The locality was the banqueting room at Whitehall, of which the upper
part, ‘where the state is placed’, and the sides were ‘theatred’ with
pillars and scaffolds. At the lower end was a triumphal arch, ‘which
enclosed the whole works’ and behind it the scene, from which a curtain
was drawn. Above was a clouded sky; beneath a sea bounded by two
promontories bearing pillars of gold, and in front ‘a pair of stairs
made exceeding curiously in form of a scallop shell’, between two
gardens with seats for the maskers. After the first antimask, danced
‘in a strange kind of confusion’, the Destinies brought the Queen a
golden tree, whence she plucked a bough to disenchant the Knights,
who then appeared, six from a cloud, six from the golden pillars.
The scene changed, and ‘London with the Thames is very artificially
presented’. The maskers gave the first and second dance, and then
danced with the ladies, ‘wherein spending as much time as they held
fitting, they returned to the seats provided for them’. Barges then
brought the second antimask. After the maskers’ last dance, the Squires
complimented the royalties and bridal pair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span></p>

<p>This was a wedding mask, by lords and gentlemen. The maskers were
the Duke of Lennox, the Earls of Pembroke, Dorset, Salisbury, and
Montgomery, the Lords Walden, Scroope, North, and Hay, Sir Thomas,
Sir Henry, and Sir Charles Howard. The ‘workmanship’ was undertaken
by ‘M. Constantine’ [Servi], ‘but he being too much of himself, and
no way to be drawn to impart his intentions, failed so far in the
assurance he gave that the main invention, even at the last cast, was
of force drawn into a far narrower compass than was from the beginning
intended’. One song was by Nicholas Lanier; three were by [Giovanni]
Coprario and were sung by John Allen and Lanier. G. F. Biondi informed
Carleton on 24 Nov. (<i>S. P. D. Jac. I</i>, lxxv. 25) of the ‘costly
ballets’ preparing for Somerset’s wedding. On 25 Nov. Chamberlain wrote
to Carleton (<i>S. P. D. Jac. I</i>, lxxv. 28; Birch, i. 278): ‘All
the talk is now of masking and feasting at these towardly marriages,
whereof the one is appointed on St. Stephen’s day, in Christmas,
the other for Twelfthtide. The King bears the charge of the first,
all saving the apparel, and no doubt the queen will do as much on
her side, which must be a mask of maids, if they may be found....
The maskers, besides the lord chamberlain’s four sons, are named to
be the Earls of Rutland, Pembroke, Montgomery, Dorset, Salisbury,
the Lords Chandos, North, Compton, and Hay; Edward Sackville, that
killed the Lord Bruce, was in the list, but was put out again; and
I marvel he would offer himself, knowing how little gracious he is,
and that he hath been assaulted once or twice since his return.’ The
Queen’s entertainment, which did not prove to be a mask, was Daniel’s
<i>Hymen’s Triumph</i>. The actual list of performers in the mask of 26
Dec. was somewhat differently made up. On 18 Nov. Lord Suffolk had sent
invitations through Sir Thomas Lake to the Earl of Rutland and Lord
Willoughby d’Eresby (<i>S. P. D. Jac. I</i>, lxxv. 15; Reyher, 505),
but apparently neither accepted. He also wrote to Lake on 8 Dec. (<i>S.
P. D. Jac. I</i>, lxxv. 37) hoping that Sackville might be allowed to
take part, not in the mask, but in the tilt (as in fact he did), at
his cousin’s wedding. On 30 Dec. Chamberlain sent Alice Carleton an
accurate list of the actual maskers (<i>S. P. D. Jac. I</i>, lxxv. 53;
Birch, i. 285), with the comment, ‘I hear little or no commendation
of the mask made by the lords that night, either for device or
dancing, only it was rich and costly’. The ‘great bravery’ and masks
at the wedding are briefly recorded by Gawdy, 175, and a list of the
festivities is given by Howes in Stowe, <i>Annales</i> (1615), 928.
He records five in all: ‘A gallant maske of Lords’ [Campion’s] on 26
Dec., the wedding night, ‘a maske of the princes gentlemen’ on 29 Dec.
and 3 Jan. [Jonson’s <i>Irish Mask</i>], ‘2 seuerall pleasant maskes’
at Merchant Taylors on 4 Jan. [including Middleton’s lost <i>Mask of
Cupid</i>], and a Gray’s Inn mask on 6 Jan. [<i>Flowers</i>].</p>

<p>The ambassadorial complications of the year are described by Finett,
12 (cf. Sullivan, 84). Spain had been in the background at the
royal wedding of the previous year, and as there was a new Spanish
ambassador (Sarmiento) this was made an excuse for asking him with
the archiducal ambassador on 26 Dec. and the French and Venetian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>
ambassadors on 6 Jan. By way of compensation these were also asked to
the Roxburghe-Drummond wedding on 2 Feb. They received purely formal
invitations to the Somerset wedding, and returned excuses for staying
away. The agents of Florence and Savoy were asked, and when they raised
the question of precedence were told that they were not ambassadors and
might scramble for places.</p>

<p>I am not quite clear whether the costs of this mask, as well as of
Jonson’s <i>Irish Mask</i>, fell on the Exchequer. Chamberlain’s notice
of 25 Nov. (<i>vide supra</i>) is not conclusive. Reyher, 523, assigns
most of the financial documents to the <i>Irish Mask</i>, but an
account of the Works for an arch and pilasters to the Lords’ mask; and
the payment to Meredith Morgan in Sept. 1614 (<i>S. P. D. Jac. I</i>,
lxxvii. 92), which he does not cite, appears from the Calendar to be
for more than one mask. The <i>Irish Mask</i> needed no costly scenery.</p>

<p>J[ohn] B[ruce], (<i>Camden Misc.</i> v), describes a late eighteenth
or early nineteenth century forgery, of unknown origin, purporting to
describe one of the masks at the Somerset wedding and other events. The
details used belong partly to 1613–14 and partly to 1614–15.</p>


<p class="p-left p2">ELIZABETH, LADY CARY (1586–1639).</p>


<p class="center p1"><i>Mariam. 1602 &lt; &gt; 5.</i></p>

<p>I have omitted a notice of this closet play, printed in 1613, by a
slip, and can only add to the edition (<i>M. S. C.</i>) of 1914 that
Lady Cary was married in 1602 (Chamberlain, 199), not 1600. She wrote
an earlier play on a Syracusan theme.</p>


<p class="p-left p2">SIR ROBERT CECIL, EARL OF SALISBURY (1563–1612).</p>

<p>But few details of the numerous royal entertainments given by Sir
William Cecil, Lord Burghley, and his sons Sir Thomas Cecil, Lord
Burghley and afterwards Earl of Exeter, and Sir Robert Cecil, Earl of
Salisbury, are upon record. It is, on the whole, convenient to note
here, rather than in ch. xxiv, those which have a literary element.
Robert Cecil contributed to that of 1594, and possibly to others.</p>


<p class="center p1">i. <i>Theobalds Entertainment of 1571 (William Lord Burghley).</i></p>

<p>Elizabeth was presented with verses and a picture of the newly-finished
house on 21 Sept. 1571 (Haynes-Murdin, ii. 772).</p>


<p class="center p1">ii. <i>Theobalds Entertainment of 1591 (William Lord Burghley).</i></p>

<p>Elizabeth came for 10–20 May 1591, and knighted Robert Cecil.</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) Strype, <i>Annals</i>, iv. 108, and Nichols, <i>Eliz.</i>
iii. 75, print a mock charter, dated 10 May 1591, and addressed by
Lord Chancellor Hatton, in the Queen’s name, ‘To the disconsolate and
retired spryte, the Heremite of Tybole’, in which he is called upon to
return to the world.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Collier, i. 276, followed by Bullen, <i>Peele</i>, ii.
305, prints from a MS. in the collection of Frederic Ouvry a Hermit’s
speech, subscribed with the initials G. P. and said by Collier to be in
Peele’s hand. This is a petition to the Queen for a writ to cause the
founder of the hermit’s cell to restore it. This founder has himself
occupied it for two years<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span> and a few months since the death of his
wife, and has obliged the hermit to govern his house. Numerous personal
allusions make it clear that the ‘founder’ is Burghley, and as Lady
Burghley died 4 April 1589, the date should be in 1591.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Bullen, <i>Peele</i>, ii. 309, following Dyce, prints two
speeches by a Gardener and a Mole Catcher, communicated by Collier to
Dyce from another MS. The ascription to Peele is conjectural, and R.
W. Bond, <i>Lyly</i>, i. 417, claims them, also by conjecture, for
Lyly. However this may be, they are addressed to the Queen, who has
reigned thirty-three years, and introduce the gift of a jewel in a
box. Elizabeth had not reigned full thirty-three years in May 1591,
but perhaps near enough. That Theobalds was the locality is indicated
by a reference to Pymms at Edmonton, a Cecil property 6 miles from
Theobalds, as occupied by ‘the youngest son of this honourable old
man’. One is bound to mistrust manuscripts communicated by Collier,
but there is evidence that Burghley retired to ‘Colling’s Lodge’ near
Theobalds in grief at his wife’s death in 1589, and also that in 1591,
when he failed to establish Robert Cecil as Secretary, he made a
diplomatic pretence of giving up public life (Hume, <i>The Great Lord
Burghley</i>, 439, 446).</p>


<p class="center p1">iii. <i>Theobalds Entertainment of 1594 (William Lord Burghley)</i>.</p>

<p>The Hermit was brought into play again when Elizabeth next visited
Theobalds, in 1594 (13–23 June). He delivered an Oration, in which he
recalled the recovery of his cell at her last coming, and expressed
a fear that ‘my young master’ might wish to use it. No doubt the
alternative was that Robert Cecil should become Secretary. The oration,
‘penned by Sir Robert Cecill’, is printed by Nichols, <i>Eliz.</i> iii.
241, from <i>Bodl. Rawlinson MS. D</i> 692 (<i>Bodl.</i> 13464), f. 106.</p>


<p class="center p1">iv. <i>Wimbledon Entertainment of 1599 (Thomas Lord Burghley)</i>.</p>

<p>A visit of 27–30 July 1599 is the probable occasion for an address of
welcome, not mimetic in character, by a porter, John Joye, preserved
in <i>Bodl. Tanner MS.</i> 306, f. 266, and endorsed ‘The queenes
entertainment att Wimbledon 99’.</p>


<p class="center p1">v. <i>Cecil House Entertainment of 1602 (Sir Robert Cecil).</i></p>

<p>Elizabeth dined with Cecil on 6 Dec. 1602.</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) Manningham, 99, records, ‘Sundry devises; at hir entraunce,
three women, a maid, a widdowe, and a wife, each commending their owne
states, but the Virgin preferred; an other, on attired in habit of a
Turke desyrous to see hir Majestie, but as a straunger without hope of
such grace, in regard of the retired manner of hir Lord, complained;
answere made, howe gracious hir Majestie in admitting to presence, and
howe able to discourse in anie language; whiche the Turke admired,
and, admitted, presents hir with a riche mantle.’ Chamberlain, 169,
adds, ‘You like the Lord Kepers devises so ill, that I cared not to get
Mr. Secretaries that were not much better, saving<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span> a pretty dialogue
of John Davies ’twixt a Maide, a widow, and a wife.’ <i>A Contention
Betwixt a Wife, a Widdow, and a Maide</i> was registered on 2 Apr. 1604
(Arber iii. 258), appeared with the initials I. D. in Francis Davison’s
<i>Poetical Rhapsody</i> (ed. 2, 1608) and is reprinted by Grosart in
the <i>Poems</i> of Sir John Davies (q.v.) from the ed. of 1621, where
it is ascribed to ‘Sir I. D.’.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Nichols, <i>Eliz.</i> iii. 76, prints from <i>Harl. MS.</i>
286, f. 248, ‘A Conference betweene a Gent. Huisher and a Poet, before
the Queene, at M<sup>r</sup>. Secretaryes House. By John Davies.’ He assigns it
to 1591, but Cecil was not then Secretary, and it probably belongs to
1602.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) <i>Hatfield MSS</i>. xii. 568 has verses endorsed ‘1602’ and
beginning ‘Now we have present made, To Cynthya, Phebe, Flora’.</p>

<p class="p-left p2">GEORGE CHAPMAN (<i>c.</i> 1560–1634).</p>

<p>Chapman was born in 1559 or 1560 near Hitchin in Hertfordshire.
Anthony Wood believed him to have been at Oxford, and possibly also at
Cambridge, but neither residence can be verified. It is conjectured
that residence at Hitchin and soldiering in the Low Countries may have
helped to fill the long period before his first appearance as a writer,
unless indeed the isolated translation <i>Fedele and Fortunio</i>
(1584) is his, with <i>The Shadow of Night</i> (1594). This shows him
a member of the philosophical circle of which the centre was Thomas
Harriot. The suggestion of W. Minto that he was the ‘rival poet’ of
Shakespeare’s <i>Sonnets</i> is elaborated by Acheson, who believes
that Shakespeare drew him as Holophernes and as Thersites, and accepted
by Robertson; it would be more plausible if any relation between the
Earl of Southampton and Chapman, earlier than a stray dedication shared
with many others in 1609, could be established. By 1596, and possibly
earlier, Chapman was in Henslowe’s pay as a writer for the Admiral’s.
His plays, which proved popular, included, besides the extant <i>Blind
Beggar of Alexandria</i> and <i>Humorous Day’s Mirth</i>, five others,
of which some and perhaps all have vanished. These were <i>The Isle
of a Woman</i>, afterwards called <i>The Fount of New Fashions</i>
(May–Oct. 1598), <i>The World Runs on Wheels</i>, afterwards called
<i>All Fools but the Fool</i> (Jan.–July 1599), <i>Four Kings</i> (Oct.
1598–Jan. 1599), a ‘tragedy of Bengemens plotte’ (Oct.–Jan. 1598;
cf. s.v. Jonson) and a pastoral tragedy (July 1599). His reputation
both for tragedy and for comedy was established when Meres wrote his
<i>Palladis Tamia</i> in 1598. During 1599 Chapman disappears from
Henslowe’s diary, and in 1600 or soon after began his series of plays
for the Chapel, afterwards Queen’s Revels, children. This lasted until
1608, when his first indiscretion of <i>Eastward Ho!</i> (1605), in
reply to which he was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span> caricatured as Bellamont in Dekker and Webster’s
<i>Northward Ho!</i>, was followed by a second in <i>Byron</i>. He now
probably dropped his connexion with the stage, at any rate for many
years. After completing Marlowe’s <i>Hero and Leander</i> in 1598, he
had begun his series of Homeric translations, and these Prince Henry,
to whom he had been appointed sewer in ordinary at the beginning of
James’s reign, now bade him pursue, with the promise of £300, to which
on his death-bed in 1612 he added another of a life-pension. These
James failed to redeem, and Chapman also lost his place as sewer. His
correspondence contains complaints of poverty, probably of this or a
later date, and indications of an attempt, with funds supplied by a
brother, to mend his fortunes by marriage with a widow. He found a new
patron in the Earl of Somerset, wrote one of the masks for the wedding
of the Princess Elizabeth in 1613, and went on with Homer, completing
his task in 1624. He lived until 12 May 1634, and his tomb by Inigo
Jones still stands at St. Giles-in-the-Fields. In his later years he
seems to have touched up some of his dramatic work and possibly to have
lent a hand to the younger dramatist Shirley. Jonson told Drummond in
1619 that ‘next himself, only Fletcher and Chapman could make a mask’,
and that ‘Chapman and Fletcher were loved of him’ (Laing, 4, 12), and
some of Jonson’s extant letters appear to confirm the kindly relations
which these phrases suggest. But a fragment of invective against Jonson
left by Chapman on his death-bed suggests that they did not endure for
ever.</p>

<p>The play was produced by the Admiral’s on 12 Feb. 1596; properties
were bought for a revival in May and June 1601. P. A. Daniel shows in
<i>Academy</i> (1888), ii. 224, that five of the six passages under the
head of <i>Irus</i> in <i>Edward Pudsey’s Notebook</i>, taken in error
by R. Savage, <i>Stratford upon Avon Notebooks</i>, i. 7 (1888) to be
from an unknown play of Shakespeare, appear with slight variants in the
1598 text. This, which is very short, probably represents a ‘cut’ stage
copy. Pudsey is traceable as an actor (cf. ch. xv) in 1626.</p>

<p>The 1598 inventories of the Admiral’s (Greg, <i>Henslowe Papers</i>,

justifies Fleay, i. 55, in identifying the play with the comedy of
<i>Humours</i> produced by that company on 1 May 1597. It is doubtless
also the play of which John Chamberlain wrote to Dudley Carleton
(Chamberlain, 4) on 11 June 1597, ‘We have here a new play of humors
in very great request, and I was drawne along to it by the common
applause, but my opinion of it is (as the fellow saide of the shearing
of hogges), that there was a great crie for so litle wolle.’</p>

<p>There is no indication of a company, but the use of a mask and songs
confirm the general probability that the play was written for the

<p>The Court performance was on 1 Jan. 1605 (cf. App. B), and the play
was therefore probably on the Blackfriars stage in 1604. There is a
reminiscence of Ophelia’s flowers in <span class="allsmcap">II.</span> i. 232, and the

<p class="p-left">But in Jan.–July 1599 Henslowe paid Chapman £8 10<i>s.</i> on behalf
of the Admiral’s for <i>The World Runs on Wheels</i>. The last
entry is for ‘his boocke called the world Rones a whelles &amp; now all
foolles but the foolle’. This seems to me, more clearly than to Greg
(<i>Henslowe</i>, ii. 203), to indicate a single play and a changed
title. I am less certain, however, that he is right in adopting the
view of Fleay, i. 59, that it was an earlier version of the Blackfriars
play. It may be so, and the date of ‘the seventeenth of November,
fifteen hundred and so forth’ used for a deed in <span class="allsmcap">IV.</span> i. 331
lends some confirmation. But the change of company raises a doubt,
and there is no ‘fool’ in <i>All Fools</i>. An alternative conjecture
is that the Admiral’s reverted to the original title for their play,
leaving a modification of the amended one available for Chapman in
1604. Collier (Dodsley<sup>3</sup>) printed a dedicatory sonnet to Sir Thomas
Walsingham. This exists only in a single copy, in which it has been
printed on an inserted leaf. T. J. Wise (<i>Ath.</i> 1908, i. 788) and
Parrott, ii. 726, show clearly that it is a forgery.</p>

<p>The play was acted by Paul’s, who disappear in 1606. It has been
suggested that it dates in some form from 1598 or earlier, because Pero
is a female character, and an Admiral’s inventory of 1598 (<i>Henslowe
Papers</i>, 120) has ‘Perowes sewt, which W<sup>m</sup> Sley were’. As Sly had
been a Chamberlain’s man since 1594, this must have been a relic of
some obsolete play. But the impossible theory seems to have left
a trace on the suggestion of Greg (<i>Henslowe</i>, ii. 198) that
Chapman may have worked on the basis of the series of plays on <i>The
Civil Wars of France</i> written by Dekker (q.v.) and others for the
Admiral’s at a later date in 1598 than that of the inventories. From
one of these plays, however, might come the reminiscence of a ‘trusty
Damboys’ in <i>Satiromastix</i> (1601), <span class="allsmcap">IV.</span> i. 174. For
<i>Bussy</i> itself a jest on ‘leap-year’ (<span class="allsmcap">I.</span> ii. 82) points
to either 1600 or 1604, and allusions to Elizabeth as an ‘old queen’
(<span class="allsmcap">I.</span> ii. 12), to a ‘knight of the new edition’ (<span class="allsmcap">I.</span>
ii. 124), with which may be compared Day, <i>Isle of Gulls</i> (1606),
i. 3, ‘gentlemen ... of the best and last edition, of the Dukes own
making’, and to a ‘new denizened lord’ (<span class="allsmcap">I.</span> ii. 173) point
to 1604 rather than 1600. The play was revived by the King’s men and
played at Court on 7 April 1634 (<i>Variorum</i>, iii. 237), and to
this date probably belongs the prologue in the edition of 1641. Here
the actors declare that the piece, which evidently others had ventured
to play, was</p>

<p class="p-left">and that his successor (perhaps Taylor) is prevented by his grey
beard from taking the young hero, which therefore falls to a ‘third
man’ who has been liked as Richard. Gayton, <i>Festivous Notes on Don
Quixote</i> (1654), 25, tells us that Eliard Swanston played Bussy;
doubtless he is the third man. The revision of the text, incorporated
in the 1641 edition, may obviously date either from this or for some
earlier revival. It is not necessary to assume that the performances
by Field referred to in the prologue were earlier than 1616, when he
joined the King’s. Parrott, however, makes it plausible that they might
have been for the Queen’s Revels at Whitefriars in 1609–12, about the
time when the <i>Revenge</i> was played by the same company. If so, the
Revels must have acquired <i>Bussy</i> after the Paul’s performances
ended in 1606. It is, of course, quite possible that they were only
recovering a play originally written for them, and carried by Kirkham
to Paul’s in 1605.</p>

<p>Jonson told Drummond in 1619 (Laing, 20): ‘He was dilated by Sir James
Murray to the King, for writing something against the Scots, in a play
Eastward Hoe, and voluntarly imprissoned himself with Chapman and
Marston, who had written it amongst them. The report was, that they
should then [have] had their ears cut and noses. After their delivery,
he banqueted all his friends; there was Camden, Selden, and others;
at the midst of the feast his old Mother dranke to him, and shew him
a paper which she had (if the sentence had taken execution) to have
mixed in the prisson among his drinke, which was full of lustie strong
poison, and that she was no churle, she told, she minded first to have
drunk of it herself.’ The <i>Hatfield MSS.</i> contain a letter (i)
from Jonson (Cunningham, <i>Jonson</i>, i. xlix), endorsed ‘1605’, to
the Earl of Salisbury, created 4 May 1605. Another copy is in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>
MS. described by B. Dobell, with ten other letters, of which Dobell,
followed by Schelling, prints three by Jonson, (ii) to an unnamed
lord, probably Suffolk, (iii) to an unnamed earl, (iv) to an unnamed
‘excellentest of Ladies’, and three by Chapman, (v) to the King, (vi)
to Lord Chamberlain Suffolk, (vii) to an unnamed lord, probably also
Suffolk. These, with four others by Chapman not printed, have no dates,
but all, with (i), seem to refer to the same joint imprisonment of
the two poets. In (i) Jonson says that he and Chapman are in prison
‘unexamined and unheard’. The cause is a play of which ‘no man can
justly complain’, for since his ‘first error’ and its ‘bondage’ [1597]
Jonson has ‘attempered my style’ and his books have never ‘given
offence to a nation, to a public order or state, or to any person of
honour or authority’. The other letters add a few facts. In (v) Chapman
says that the ‘chief offences are but two clawses, and both of them
not our owne’; in (vi) that ‘our unhappie booke was presented without
your Lordshippes allowance’; and in (vii) that they are grateful
for an expected pardon of which they have heard from Lord Aubigny.
Castelain, <i>Jonson</i>, 901, doubts whether this correspondence
refers to <i>Eastward Ho!</i>, chiefly because there is no mention of
Marston, and after hesitating over <i>Sejanus</i>, suggests <i>Sir
Giles Goosecap</i> (q.v.), which is not worth consideration. Jonson was
in trouble for <i>Sejanus</i> (q.v.), but on grounds not touched on in
these letters, and Chapman was not concerned. I feel no doubt that the
imprisonment was that for <i>Eastward Ho!</i> Probably Drummond was
wrong about Marston, who escaped. His ‘absence’ is noted in the t.p.
of Q<sub>2</sub> of <i>The Fawn</i> (1606), and chaffed by A. Nixon, <i>The
Black Year</i> (1606): ‘Others ... arraign other mens works ... when
their own are sacrificed in Paul’s Churchyard, for bringing in the
Dutch Courtesan to corrupt English conditions and sent away westward
for carping both at court, city, and country.’ Evidently Jonson and
Chapman, justly or not, put the blame of the obnoxious clauses upon
him, and renewed acrimony against Jonson may be traced in his Epistles
of 1606. I am inclined to think that it was the publication of the play
in the autumn of 1605, rather than its presentation on the stage, that
brought the poets into trouble. This would account for the suppression
of a passage reflecting upon the Scots (<span class="allsmcap">III.</span> iii. 40–7) which
appeared in the first issue of Q<sub>1</sub> (cf. Parrott, ii. 862). Other
quips at the intruding nation, at James’s liberal knightings, and even
at his northern accent (<span class="allsmcap">I.</span> ii. 50, 98; <span class="allsmcap">II.</span> iii. 83;
<span class="allsmcap">IV.</span> i. 179) appear to have escaped censure. Nor was the play
as a whole banned. It passed to the Lady Elizabeth’s, who revived it in
1613 (<i>Henslowe Papers</i>, 71) and gave it at Court on 25 Jan. 1614
(cf. App. B). There seems to be an allusion to Suffolk’s intervention
in Chapman’s gratulatory verses to <i>Sejanus</i> (1605):</p>

<p class="p-left">The imprisonment was over by Nov. 1605, when Jonson (q.v.) was employed
about the Gunpowder plot. I put it and the correspondence in Oct. or
Nov. The play may have been staged at any time between that and the
staging of Dekker and Webster’s <i>Westward Hoe</i>, late in 1604, to
which its prologue refers. Several attempts have been made to divide
up the play. Fleay, ii. 81, gives Marston <span class="allsmcap">I.</span> i-<span class="allsmcap">II.</span>

<p>The <i>chorus iuvenum</i> with which the play opens fixes it to the
occupancy of the Blackfriars by the Chapel and Revels in 1600–9.
Parrott suggests 1602 on the ground of reminiscences of 1599–1601

18 of Marston’s <i>2 Antonio and Mellida</i> (1599), <span class="allsmcap">V.</span> ii.

<i>Gull’s Hornbook</i> (1609), which it seems to me a little arbitrary
to explain by a revision. The other reasons given by Fleay, i. 57, for
a date <i>c.</i> 1601 are fantastic. So is his suggestion that the play
is founded on the anonymous <i>Disguises</i> produced by the Admiral’s
on 2 Oct. 1595, which, as pointed out by Greg (<i>Henslowe</i>, ii.
177), rests merely on the fact that the title would be appropriate.</p>

<p>The play was given at Court on 27 Feb. 1613, but the reference on the
title-page to Blackfriars shows that it was originally produced by the
Chapel or Revels not later than 1609 and probably before <i>Byron</i>
(1608). Wallace, ii. 115, identifies it with the Chapel play seen by
the Duke of Stettin in 1602 (cf. ch. xii), but Gerschow’s description
in no way, except for the presence of a widow, fits the plot. The
reference<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span> to the ‘number of strange knights abroad’ (iv. 1. 28) and
perhaps also that to the crying down of monopolies (<span class="allsmcap">I.</span> i. 125)
are Jacobean, rather than Elizabethan (cf. <i>M. d’Olive</i>). Fleay,
i. 61, and Parrott think that the satire of justice in the last act
shows resentment at Chapman’s treatment in connexion with <i>Eastward
Ho!</i>, and suggest 1605. It would be equally sound to argue that
this is just the date when Chapman would have been most careful to
avoid criticism of this kind. The Epistle says, ‘This poor comedy
(of many desired to see printed) I thought not utterly unworthy that

<p>In <i>M. L. Review</i>, iv. 158, I reprinted a less good text from
<i>Ambassades de M. De La Boderie</i> (1750), iii. 196. The letter
is often dated 1605 and ascribed to De La Boderie’s predecessor, M.
de Beaumont, on the strength of a summary in F. L. G. von Raumer,
<i>History of the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries</i>, ii. 219. The
text has been ruthlessly censored; in particular the peccant scene has
been cut out of Act <span class="allsmcap">II</span> of Part ii, and most of Act <span class="allsmcap">IV</span>
of Part i, dealing with Byron’s visit to England, has been suppressed
or altered. The Epistle offers ‘these poor dismembered poems’, and they
are probably the subject of two undated and unsigned letters printed
by Dobell in <i>Ath.</i> (1901), i. 433. The first, to one Mr. Crane,
secretary to the Duke of Lennox, inquires whether the writer can leave
a ‘shelter’ to which ‘the austeritie of this offended time’ has sent
him. The other is by ‘the poor subject of your office’ and evidently
addressed to the Master of the Revels, and complains of his strictness
in revising for the press what the Council had passed for presentment.
Worcester’s men had an anonymous play of <i>Byron</i> (<i>Burone</i>
or <i>Berowne</i>) in 1602, and Greg (<i>Henslowe</i>, ii. 231) thinks
that to this Chapman’s may have borne some relation. But Chapman’s
source was Grimeston, <i>General Inventorie of the History of
France</i> (1607).</p>

<p>Boas has shown that Chapman used Grimeston, <i>General Inventorie
of the History of France</i> (1607). Probably the play was written
for the Queen’s Revels to accompany <i>Bussy</i>. But whether it was
first produced at Whitefriars in 1609–12, or at Blackfriars in 1608–9,
can hardly be settled. The title-page and the probability that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>
<i>Byron</i> affair would render it judicious to defer further plays
by Chapman rather point to the Whitefriars. The Epistle commends the
play because ‘Howsoever therefore in the scenical presentation it might
meet with some maligners, yet considering even therein it passed with
approbation of more worthy judgments’.</p>

<p>The play was licensed by Herbert as Shirley’s on 29 April 1635

<p>Chapman says that the play was written ‘long since’ and ‘never touched
at the stage’. Various dates have been conjectured; the last, Parrott’s
1612–13, ‘based upon somewhat intangible evidence of style and rhythm’
will do as well as another. Parrott is puzzled by the 1653 title-page
and thinks that, in spite of the Epistle, the play was acted. Might it
not have been acted by the King’s after the original publication in
1631? Plays on Caesar were so common that it is not worth pursuing the
suggestion of Fleay, i. 65, that fragments of the Admiral’s anonymous
<i>Caesar and Pompey</i> of 1594–5 may survive here.</p>


<p class="center p1"><i>Doubtful and Lost Plays</i></p>

<p>Chapman’s lost plays for the Admiral’s men of 1598–9 have already been
noted. Two plays, ‘The Fatall Love, a French Tragedy’, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span> ‘A Tragedy
of a Yorkshire Gentlewoman and her sonne’, were entered as his in the
<i>S. R.</i> by Humphrey Moseley on 29 June 1660 (Eyre, ii. 271). They
appear, without Chapman’s name, in Warburton’s list of burnt plays
(W. W. Greg in <i>3 Library</i>, ii. 231). The improbable ascriptions
to Chapman of <i>The Ball</i> (1639) and <i>Revenge for Honour</i>
(1654) on their t.ps. and of <i>Two Wise Men and All the Rest Fools</i>
(1619) by Kirkman in 1661 do not inspire confidence in this late entry,
and even if they were Chapman’s, the plays were not necessarily of
our period. But it has been suggested that <i>Fatal Love</i> may be
the anonymous <i>Charlemagne</i> (q.v.). J. M. Robertson assigns to
Chapman <i>A Lover’s Complaint</i>, accepts the conjecture of Minto and
Acheson that he was the ‘rival poet’ of Shakespeare’s <i>Sonnets</i>,
believes him to be criticized in the Holophernes of <i>L. L. L.</i>
and regards him as the second hand of <i>Timon of Athens</i>, and with
varying degrees of assurance as Shakespeare’s predecessor, collaborator
or reviser, in <i>Per.</i>, <i>T. C.</i>, <i>Tp.</i>, <i>Ham.</i>,
<i>Cymb.</i>, <i>J. C.</i>, <i>T. of S.</i>, <i>Hen. VI</i>, <i>Hen.

W.</i>, <i>K. J.</i>, <i>Hen. VIII</i>. These are issues which cannot
be discussed here. The records do not suggest any association between
Chapman and the Chamberlain’s or King’s men, except possibly in
Caroline days.</p>

<p><i>Edition</i> in Nichols, <i>James</i> (1828), ii. 566.</p>

<p>The maskers, in cloth of silver embroidered with gold, olive-coloured
vizards, and feathers on their heads, were Princes of Virginia; the
torchbearers also Virginians; the musicians Phoebades or Priests of
Virginia; the antimaskers a ‘mocke-maske’ of Baboons; the presenters
Plutus, Capriccio a Man of Wit, Honour, Eunomia her Priest, and Phemis
her Herald.</p>

<p>The locality was the Hall at Whitehall, whither the maskers rode
from the house of the Master of the Rolls, with their musicians
and presenters in chariots, Moors to attend their horses, and a
large escort of gentlemen and halberdiers. They dismounted in the
tiltyard, where the King and lords beheld them from a gallery. The
scene represented a high rock, which cracked to emit Capriccio, and
had the Temple of Honour on one side, and a hollow tree, ‘the bare
receptacle of the baboonerie’, on the other. After ‘the presentment’
and the ‘anticke’ dance of the ‘ante-maske’, the top of the rock
opened to disclose the maskers and torchbearers in a mine of gold
under the setting sun. They descended by steps within the rock. First
the torchbearers ‘performed another ante-maske, dancing with torches
lighted at both ends’. Then the maskers danced two dances, followed by
others with the ladies, and finally a ‘dance, that brought them off’ to
the Temple of Honour.</p>

<p>For general notices of the wedding masks, see ch. xxiv and the account
of Campion’s Lords’ mask. The German <i>Beschreibung</i> (1613) gives a
long abstract of Chapman’s (extract in <i>Sh.-Jahrbuch</i>, xxix. 172),
but this is clearly paraphrased from the author’s own description. It
was perhaps natural for Sir Edward Philips to write to Carleton on 25
Feb. (<i>S. P. D. Jac. I</i>, lxxii. 46) that this particular mask
was ‘praised above all others’. But Chamberlain is no less laudatory
(Birch, i. 226):</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘On Monday night, was the Middle Temple and Lincoln’s Inn mask
prepared in the hall at court, whereas the Lords’ was in the
banqueting room. It went from the Rolls, all up Fleet Street
and the Strand, and made such a gallant and glorious show,
that it is highly commended. They had forty gentlemen of best
choice out of both houses, and the twelve maskers, with their
torchbearers and pages, rode likewise upon horses exceedingly
well trapped and furnished, besides a dozen little boys, dressed
like baboons, that served for an antimask, and, they say,
performed it exceedingly well when they came to it; and three
open chariots, drawn with four horses apiece, that carried their
musicians and other personages that had parts to speak. All
which, together with their trumpeters and other attendants, were
so well set out, that it is generally held for the best show
that hath been seen many a day. The King stood in the gallery
to behold them, and made them ride about the Tilt-yard, and
then they were received into St. James’ Park, and so out, all
along the galleries, into the hall, where themselves and their
devices, which they say were excellent, made such a glittering
show, that the King and all the company were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span> exceedingly
pleased, and especially with their dancing, which was beyond all
that hath been seen yet. The King made the masters [? maskers]
kiss his hand on parting, and gave them many thanks, saying, he
never saw so many proper men together, and himself accompanied
them at the banquet, and took care it should be well ordered,
and speaks much of them behind their backs, and strokes the
Master of the Rolls and Dick Martin, who were chief doers and
undertakers.’</p>
</div>

<p>Chamberlain wrote more briefly, but with equal commendation, to Winwood
(iii. 435), while the Venetian ambassador reported that the mask was
danced ‘with such finish that it left nothing to be desired’ (<i>V.
P.</i> xii. 532).</p>

<p>The mask is but briefly noticed in the published records of the Middle
Temple (Hopwood, 40, 42); more fully in those of Lincoln’s Inn (Walker,
ii. 150–6, 163, 170, 198, 255, 271). The Inn’s share of the cost was
£1,086 8<i>s.</i> 11<i>d.</i> and presumably that of the Middle Temple
as much. A levy was made of from £1 10<i>s.</i> to £4, according
to status, and some of the benchers and others advanced funds. A
dispute about the repayment of an advance by Lord Chief Justice
Richardson was still unsettled in 1634. An account of Christopher
Brooke as ‘Expenditour for the maske’ includes £100 to Inigo Jones
for works for the hall and street, £45 to Robert Johnson for music
and songs, £2 to Richard Ansell, matlayer, £1 to the King’s Ushers
of the Hall, and payments for a pair of stockings and other apparel
to ‘Heminge’s boy’, and for the services of John and Robert Dowland,
Philip Rosseter and Thomas Ford as musicians. The attitude of the young
lawyer may be illustrated from a letter of Sir S. Radcliffe on 1 Feb.
(<i>Letters</i>, 78), although I do not know his Inn: ‘I have taken
up 30<sup>s</sup> of James Singleton, which or y<sup>e</sup> greater part thereof is to
be paid toward y<sup>e</sup> great mask at y<sup>e</sup> marriage at Shrovetide. It is a
duty for y<sup>e</sup> honour of our Inn, and unto which I could not refuse to
contribute with any credit.’</p>

<p>A letter by Chapman, partly printed by B. Dobell in <i>Ath.</i> (1901),
i. 466, is a complaint to an unnamed paymaster about his reward for a
mask given in the royal presence at a date later than Prince Henry’s
death. While others of his faculty got 100 marks or £50, he is ‘put
with taylors and shoomakers, and such snipperados, to be paid by a
bill of particulars’. Dobell does not seem to think that this was the
wedding mask, but I see no clear reason why it should not have been.</p>

dedicated to the Marquis of Northampton.</p>


<p class="p-left p2">HENRY CHETTLE (<i>c.</i> 1560– &gt; 1607).</p>

<p>Chettle was apprenticed, as the son of Robert Chettle of London, dyer,
to Thomas East, printer, on 29 Sept. 1577, and took up the freedom
of the Stationers’ Company on 6 Oct. 1584. During 1589–91 he was in
partnership as a printer with John Danter and William Hoskins. The
partnership was then dissolved, and Chettle’s imprint is not found on
any book of later date (McKerrow, <i>Dictionary</i>, 68, 84, 144). But
evidently his connexion with the press and with Danter continued, for
in 1596 Nashe inserted into <i>Have With You to Saffron Walden</i>
(<i>Works</i>, iii. 131) a letter from him offering to set up the book
and signed ‘Your old Compositer, Henry Chettle’. Nashe’s <i>Strange
News</i> (1592) and <i>Terrors of the Night</i> (1594) had come,
like <i>Have With You to Saffron Walden</i> itself, from Danter’s
press. The object of the letter was to defend Nashe against a charge
in Gabriel Harvey’s <i>Pierce’s Supererogation</i> (1593) of having
abused Chettle. He had in fact in <i>Pierce Penilesse</i> (1592) called
<i>Greenes Groats-worth of Wit</i> ‘a scald triuial lying pamphlet’,
and none of his doing. And of the <i>Groats-worth</i> Chettle had acted
as editor, as he himself explains in the Epistle to his <i>Kind Hearts
Dream</i> (cf. App. C, No. xlix), in which, however, he exculpates
Nashe from any share in the book. By 1595 he was married and had lost
a daughter Mary, who was buried at St. John’s, Windsor (E. Ashmole,
<i>Antiquities of Berkshire</i>, iii. 75). By 1598 he had taken to
writing for the stage, and in his <i>Palladis Tamia</i> of that
year Meres includes him in ‘the best for Comedy amongst vs’. Of all
Henslowe’s band of needy writers for the Admiral’s and Worcester’s
from 1598 to 1603, he was the most prolific and one of the neediest.
Of the forty-eight plays in which he had a hand during this period,
no more than five, or possibly six, survive. His personal loans from
Henslowe were numerous and often very small. Some were on account of
the Admiral’s; others on a private account noted in the margin of
Henslowe’s diary. On 16 Sept. 1598 he owed the Admiral’s £8 9<i>s.</i>
in balance, ‘al his boockes &amp; recknynges payd’. In Nov. 1598 he had
loans ‘for to areste one with Lord Lester’. In Jan. 1599 he was in the
Marshalsea, and in May borrowed to avoid arrest by one Ingrome. On 25
Mar. 1602 he was driven, apparently in view of a payment of £3, to seal
a bond to write for the Admiral’s. This did not prevent him from also
writing for Worcester’s in the autumn. More than once his manuscript
had to be redeemed from pawn (Greg, <i>Henslowe</i>, ii. 250). His
<i>England’s Mourning Garment</i>, a eulogy of Elizabeth, is reprinted
in C. M. Ingleby, <i>Shakespere Allusion-Books</i>, Part i (<i>N. S.
S.</i> 1874), 77. Herein he speaks of himself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span> as ‘courting it now and
than’, when he was ‘yong, almost thirtie yeeres agoe’, and calls on a
number of poets under fanciful names to sing the dead queen’s praise.
They are Daniel, Warner, Chapman (Coryn), Jonson (our English Horace),
Shakespeare (Melicert), Drayton (Coridon), Lodge (Musidore), Dekker
(Antihorace), Marston (Moelibee), and Petowe (?). Chettle was therefore
alive in 1603, but he is spoken of as dead in Dekker’s <i>Knight’s
Conjuring</i> (1607).</p>

<p>Henslowe paid Chettle, on behalf of the Admiral’s, £1 in earnest of ‘a
Danyshe tragedy’ on 7 July 1602, and 5<i>s.</i> in part payment for a
tragedy of ‘Howghman’ on 29 Dec. It seems natural to take the latter,
and perhaps also the former, entry as relating to this play, although
it does not bear Chettle’s name on the title-page. But its completion
was presumably later than the termination of Henslowe’s record in 1603.
Greg (<i>Henslowe</i>, ii. 226) rightly repudiates the suggestion of
Fleay, i. 70, 291, that we are justified in regarding <i>Hoffman</i>
the unnamed tragedy of Chettle and Heywood in Jan. 1603, for which a
blank can of course afford no evidence. But ‘the Prince of the burning
crowne’ is referred to in Kempe’s <i>Nine Daies Wonder</i>, 22, not as
a ‘play’, but as a suggested theme for a ballad writer.</p>

<p class="p-left p2">THOMAS CHURCHYARD (1520?-1604).</p>

<p>The best account of Churchyard is that by H. W. Adnitt in <i>Shropshire
Arch. Soc. Trans.</i> iii (1880), 1, with a bibliography of his
numerous poems. For his share in the devices of the Bristol
entertainment (<i>1574</i>) and the Suffolk and Norfolk progress
(<i>1578</i>), of both of which he published descriptions, cf. ch.
xxiv. He was also engaged by the Shrewsbury corporation to prepare a
show for an expected but abandoned royal visit in 1575 (<i>Mediaeval
Stage</i>, ii. 255). His <i>A Handful of Gladsome Verses given to the
Queenes Maiesty at Woodstocke this Prograce</i> (1592) is reprinted in
H. Huth and W. C. Hazlitt, <i>Fugitive Tracts</i> (1875), i. It is not
mimetic. His own account of his work in <i>Churchyard’s Challenge</i>
(1593) suggests that he took a considerable part in Elizabethan
pageantry. He says that he wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘The deuises of warre and a play at Awsterley. Her Highnes being
at Sir Thomas Greshams’,</p>
</div>

<p class="p-left">and</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘The deuises and speeches that men and boyes shewed within many
prograces’.</p>
</div>

<p class="p-left">And amongst ‘Workes ... gotten from me of some such noble
friends as I am loath to offend’ he includes:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘A book of a sumptuous shew in Shrouetide, by Sir Walter Rawley,
Sir Robart Carey, M. Chidley, and M. Arthur Gorge, in which book

as good verse as euer I made: an honorable knight, dwelling in
the Black-Friers, can witness the same, because I read it vnto
him.’</p>
</div>

<p class="p-left">The natural date for this ‘shew’ is Shrovetide 1587. I do not know
why Nichols, <i>Eliz.</i> ii. 279, dates the Osterley device 1579.
Elizabeth was often there, but I find no evidence of a visit in 1579.
Lowndes speaks of the work as in print, but I doubt whether he has
any authority beyond Churchyard’s own notice, which does not prove
publication.</p>


<p class="p-left p2">ANTHONY CHUTE (<i>ob. c.</i> 1595).</p>

<p>Nashe in his <i>Have With You to Saffron Walden</i> (1596,
<i>Works</i>, iii. 107), attacking Chute as a friend of Gabriel
Harvey, says, ‘he hath kneaded and daub’d vp a Commedie, called The
transformation of the King of <i>Trinidadoes</i> two Daughters, Madame
<i>Panachaea</i> and the Nymphe <i>Tobacco</i>; and, to approue his
Heraldrie, scutchend out the honorable Armes of the smoakie Societie’.
I hesitate to take this literally.</p>


<p class="p-left p2">GEORGE CLIFFORD (1558–1605).</p>

<p>George Clifford was born 8 Aug. 1558, succeeded as third Earl of
Cumberland 8 Jan. 1570, and died 30 Oct. 1605. A recent biography is
G. C. Williamson, <i>George, Third Earl of Cumberland</i> (1920). He
married Margaret Russell, daughter of Francis, second Earl of Bedford,
on 24 June 1577. His daughter, Anne Clifford, who left an interesting
autobiography, married firstly Richard, third Earl of Dorset, and
secondly Philip, fourth Earl of Pembroke. Cumberland was prominent in
Elizabethan naval adventure and shone in the tilt. He is recorded as
appearing on 17 Nov. 1587 (Gawdy, 25) and 26 Aug. 1588 (<i>Sp. P.</i>
iv. 419). On 17 Nov. 1590 he succeeded Sir Henry Lee (q.v.) as Knight
of the Crown. Thereafter he was the regular challenger for the Queen’s
Day tilt, often with the assistance of the Earl of Essex. On 17 Nov.
1592 they came together armed into the privy chamber, and issued a
challenge to maintain against all comers on the following 26 Feb. ‘that
ther M. is most worthyest and most fayrest Amadis de Gaule’ (Gawdy,
67). Cumberland’s tiltyard speeches, as Knight of Pendragon Castle, in
1591 (misdated 1592) and 1593 are printed by Williamson, 108, 121, from
manuscripts at Appleby Castle.</p>

<p>His appearance as Knight of the Crown on 17 Nov. 1595 is noted in
Peele’s (q.v.) <i>Anglorum Feriae</i>. In F. Davison’s <i>Poetical
Rhapsody</i> (1602, ed. Bullen, ii. 128) is an ode <i>Of Cynthia</i>,
with the note ‘This Song was sung before her sacred Maiestie at a shew
on horse-backe, wherwith the right Honorable the Earle of Cumberland
presented her Highnesse on Maie day last’. This is reprinted by R.
W. Bond (<i>Lyly</i>, i. 414) with alternative ascriptions to Lyly
and to Sir John Davies. But Cumberland himself wrote verses. I do not
know why Bullen and Bond assume that the show was on 1 May 1600. The
<i>Cumberland MSS.</i> at Bolton, Yorkshire, once contained a prose
speech, now lost, in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span> character of a melancholy knight, headed ‘A
Copie of my Lord of Combrlandes Speeche to y<sup>e</sup> Queene, upon y<sup>e</sup> 17 day
of November, 1600’. This was printed by T. D. Whitaker, <i>History
of Craven</i> (1805, ed. Morant, 1878, p. 355), and reprinted by
Nichols, <i>Eliz.</i> iii. 522, and by Bond, <i>Lyly</i>, i. 415, with
a conjectural attribution to Lyly. In 1601 Cumberland conveyed to Sir
John Davies a suggestion from Sir R. Cecil that he should write a
‘speech for introduction of the barriers’ (<i>Hatfield MSS.</i> xi.
544), and in letters of 1602 he promised Cecil to appear at the tilt
on Queen’s Day, but later tried to excuse himself on the ground that a
damaged arm would not let him carry a staff (<i>Hatfield MSS.</i> xii.
438, 459, 574). Anne Clifford records ‘speeches and delicate presents’
at Grafton when James and Anne visited the Earl there on 27 June 1603
(Wiffen, ii. 71).</p>


<p class="p-left p2">JO. COOKE (<i>c.</i> 1612).</p>

<p>Beyond his play, practically nothing is known of Cooke. It is not
even clear whether ‘Jo.’ stands for John, or for Joshua; the latter
is suggested by the manuscript ascription on a copy of the anonymous
<i>How a Man may Choose a Good Wife from a Bad</i> (q.v.). Can
Cooke be identical with the I. Cocke who contributed to Stephens’s
<i>Characters</i> in 1615 (cf. App. C, No. lx)? Collier, iii. 408,
conjectures that he was a brother John named, probably as dead, in the
will (3 Jan. 1614) of Alexander Cooke the actor (cf. ch. xv). There is
an entry in S. R. on 22 May 1604 of a lost ‘Fyftie epigrams written by
J. Cooke Gent’, and a ‘I. Cooke’ wrote commendatory verses to Drayton’s
<i>Legend of Cromwell</i> (1607).</p>

<p>Heywood writes ‘to gratulate the love and memory of my worthy friend
the author, and my entirely beloved fellow the actor’, both of whom
were evidently dead. Satire of Coryat’s <i>Crudities</i> gives a date
between its publication in 1611 and the performances of the play by the
Queen’s men at Court on 27 Dec. 1611 and 2 Feb. 1612 (cf. App. B). In
Aug. 1612 died Thomas Greene, who had evidently played Bubble at the
Red Bull (ed. Dodsley, p. 240):</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Geraldine.</i> Why, then, we’ll go to the Red Bull: they say

<p class="p-left p2">ROBERT DABORNE (?-1628).</p>

<p>Daborne claimed to be of ‘generous’ descent, and it has been
conjectured that he belonged to a family at Guildford, Surrey. Nothing
is known of him until he appears with Rosseter and others as a patentee
for the Queen’s Revels in 1610. Presumably he wrote for this company,
and when they amalgamated with the Lady Elizabeth’s in 1613 came into
relations with Henslowe, who acted as paymaster for the combination.
The Dulwich collection contains between thirty and forty letters,
bonds, and receipts bearing upon these relations. A few are undated;
the rest extend from 17 April 1613 to 4 July 1615. Most of them were
printed by Malone (<i>Variorum</i>, iii. 336), Collier (<i>Alleyn
Papers</i>, 56), and Swaen (<i>Anglia</i>, xx. 155), and all, with
a stray fragment from <i>Egerton MS.</i> 2623, f. 24, are in Greg,
<i>Henslowe Papers</i>, 65, 126. There and in <i>Henslowe</i>, ii. 141,
Dr. Greg attempts an arrangement of them and of the plays to which
they relate, which seems to me substantially sound. They show Daborne,
during the twelve months from April 1613, to which they mainly belong,
writing regularly for the Lady Elizabeth’s, but prepared at any moment
to sell a play to the King’s if he can get a better bargain. Lawsuits
and general poverty made him constantly desirous of obtaining small
advances from Henslowe, and on one occasion he was in the Clink. In
the course of the year he was at work on at least five plays (<i>vide
infra</i>), alone or in co-operation now with Tourneur, now with Field,
Massinger, and Fletcher. Modern conjectures have assigned him some
share in plays of the Beaumont and Fletcher series which there is no
external evidence to connect with his name. However this may be, it
is clear that, unless his activity in 1613–14 was abnormal, he must
have written much of which we know nothing. He is still traceable in
connexion with the stage up to 1616, giving a joint bond with Massinger
in Aug. 1615, receiving an acquittance of debts through his wife
Francisce from Henslowe on his death-bed in Jan. 1616 (<i>Henslowe</i>,
ii. 20), and witnessing the agreement between Alleyn and Meade and
Prince Charles’s men on the following 20 March. But he must have taken
orders by 1618, when he published a sermon, and he became Chancellor
of Waterford in 1619, Prebendary of Lismore in 1620, and Dean of
Lismore in 1621. On 23 March 1628 he ‘died amphibious by the ministry’
according to <i>The Time Poets</i> (<i>Choice Drollery</i>, 1656, sig.
B).</p>

Epilogue.]</p>

<p>This may, as Fleay, i. 83, says, be a Queen’s Revels play, but he
gives no definite proof, and if it is the ‘unwilling error’ apologized
for in the epilogue to <i>Mucedorus</i> (1610), it is more likely to
proceed from the King’s men. It appears to be indebted to pamphlets
on the career of its heroes, printed in 1609. The Epistle explains
the publishing of ‘this oppressed and much martird Tragedy, not that
I promise to my selfe any reputation hereby, or affect to see my name
in Print, vsherd with new praises, for feare the Reader should call
in question their iudgements that giue applause in the action; for
had this wind moued me, I had preuented others shame in subscribing
some of my former labors, or let them gone out in the diuels name
alone; which since impudence will not suffer, I am content they passe
together; it is then to publish my innocence concerning the wrong of
worthy personages, together with doing some right to the much-suffering
Actors that hath caused my name to cast it selfe in the common rack of
censure’. I do not know why the play should have been ‘martir’d’, but
incidentally Daborne seems to be claiming a share in Dekker’s <i>If It
be not Good, the Devil is in It</i> (1612).</p>

Acted at the Cockpit in Drury Lane with great applause. Written

Sweeting.</i> [Prologue, signed ‘Per E. M.’]</p>

<p>The stage-direction to l. 186 is ‘Enter 2 Lords, Sands, Ellis’. Perhaps
we have here the names of two actors, Ellis Worth, who was with Anne’s
men at the Cockpit in 1617–19, and Gregory Sanderson, who joined
the same company before May, 1619. But there is also a James Sands,
traceable as a boy of the King’s in 1605. The performances named on the
title-page are not necessarily the original ones and the play may have
been produced by the Queen’s at the Red Bull, but 1617 is as likely a
date as another, and when a courtier says of a poor man’s suit (l. 877)
that it is ‘some suit from porters<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span> hall, belike not worth begging’,
there may conceivably be an allusion to attempts to preserve the
Porter’s Hall theatre from destruction in the latter year. In any case,
Daborne is not likely to have written the play after he took orders.</p>



<p class="center p1"><i>Doubtful and Lost Plays</i></p>

<p>The Henslowe correspondence appears to show Daborne as engaged between
17 April 1613 and 2 April 1614 on the following plays:</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) <i>Machiavel and the Devil</i> (17 April-<i>c.</i> 25 June
1613), possibly, according to Fleay and Greg, <i>Henslowe</i>, ii. 152,
based on the old <i>Machiavel</i> revived by Strange’s men in 1592.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) <i>The Arraignment of London</i>, probably identical with
<i>The Bellman of London</i> (5 June–9 Dec. 1613), with Cyril Tourneur,
possibly, as Greg, <i>Henslowe Papers</i>, 75, suggests, based on
Dekker’s tract, <i>The Bellman of London</i> (1608).</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) An unnamed play with Field, Massinger, and Fletcher, the
subject of undated correspondence (<i>Henslowe Papers</i>, 65 and
possibly 70, 84) and possibly also of dated letters of July 1613 (<i>H.
P.</i> 74).</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) <i>The Owl</i> (9 Dec. 1613–28 March 1614). A comedy of this
name is in Archer’s list of 1656, but Greg, <i>Masques</i>, xcv, thinks

<p class="p-left p2">SAMUEL DANIEL (<i>c.</i> 1563–1619).</p>

<p>Daniel was born in Somerset, probably near Taunton, about 1563. His
father is said to have been John Daniel, a musician; he certainly had
a brother John, of the same profession. In 1579 he entered Magdalen
Hall, Oxford, but took no degree. He visited France about January 1585
and sent an account of political affairs from the Rue St. Jacques to
Walsingham in the following March (<i>S. P. F.</i> xix. 388). His first
work was a translation of the <i>Imprese</i> of Paulus Jovius (1585).
In 1586 he served Sir Edward Stafford, the English ambassador in Paris,
and as a young man visited Italy. He was domesticated at Wilton, and
under the patronage of Mary, Lady Pembroke, wrote his sonnets to Delia,
the publication of which, partial in 1591 and complete in 1592, gave
him a considerable reputation as a poet. The attempt of Fleay, i. 86,
to identify Delia with Elizabeth Carey, daughter of Sir George Carey,
afterwards Lord Hunsdon, breaks down. Nashe in <i>The Terrors of the
Night</i> (1594, ed. McKerrow, i. 342) calls her a ‘second Delia’,
and obviously the first was not, as Fleay suggests, Queen Elizabeth,
but the heroine of the sonnets. Delia dwelt on an Avon, but the fact
that in 1602 Lord Hunsdon took the waters at Bath does not give him a
seat on the Avon there. Lady Pembroke’s <i>Octavia</i> (q.v.) inspired
Daniel’s book-drama <i>Cleopatra</i> (1594). Other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span> poems, notably
<i>The History of the Civil Wars</i> (1595), followed. Tradition makes
Daniel poet laureate after Spenser’s death in 1599. There was probably
no such post, but it is clear from verses prefixed to a single copy
(B.M.C. 21, 2, 17) of the <i>Works</i> of 1601, which are clearly
addressed to Elizabeth, and not, as Grosart, i. 2, says, Anne, that he
had some allowance at Court:</p>

  <div class="poetry-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div>I, who by that most blessed hand sustain’d,</div>
        <div>In quietnes, do eate the bread of rest.</div>
        <div class="right">(Grosart, i. 9.)</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

<p class="p-left">Possibly, however, this grant was a little later than
1599. Daniel acted as tutor to Anne Clifford, daughter of the Earl of
Cumberland, at Skipton Castle, probably by 1599, when he published
his <i>Poetical Essays</i>, which include an <i>Epistle</i> to Lady
Cumberland. It might have been either Herbert or Clifford influence
which brought him into favour with Lady Bedford and led to his
selection as poet for the first Queen’s mask at the Christmas of 1603.
No doubt this preference aroused jealousies, and to about this date one
may reasonably assign Jonson’s verse-letter to Lady Rutland (<i>The
Forest</i>, xii) in which he speaks of his devotion to Lady Bedford:</p>

  <div class="poetry-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div class="i3">though she have a better verser got,</div>
        <div>(Or Poet, in the court-account), than I,</div>
        <div>And who doth me, though I not him envy.</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

<p class="p-left">In 1619 Jonson told Drummond that he had answered
Daniel’s <i>Defence of Ryme</i> (?1603), that ‘Samuel Daniel was a
good honest man, had no children; but no poet’, and that ‘Daniel was
at jealousies with him’ (Laing, 1, 2, 10). All this suggests to me
a rivalry at the Jacobean, rather than the Elizabethan Court, and I
concur in the criticisms of Small, 181, upon the elaborate attempts
of Fleay, i. 84, 359, to trace attacks on Daniel in Jonson’s earlier
comedies. Fleay makes Daniel Fastidious Brisk in <i>Every Man Out of
his Humour</i>, Hedon in <i>Cynthia’s Revels</i>, and alternatively
Hermogenes Tigellius and Tibullus in <i>The Poetaster</i>, as well as
Emulo in the <i>Patient Grissel</i> of Dekker and others. In most of
these equations he is followed by others, notably Penniman, who adds
(<i>Poetaster</i>, xxxvii) Matheo in <i>Every Man In his Humour</i>
and Gullio in the anonymous <i>1 Return from Parnassus</i>. For
all this the only basis is that Brisk, Matheo, and Gullio imitate
or parody Daniel’s poetry. What other poetry, then, would affected
young men at the end of the sixteenth century be likely to imitate?
Some indirect literary criticism on Daniel may be implied, but this
does not constitute the imitators portraits of Daniel. Fleay’s
further identifications of Daniel with Littlewit in <i>Bartholomew
Fair</i> and Dacus in the <i>Epigrams</i> of Sir John Davies are
equally unsatisfactory. To return to biography. In 1604 Daniel, for
the first time so far as is known, became connected with the stage,
through his appointment as licenser for the Queen’s Revels by their
patent of 4 Feb. Collier, <i>New Facts</i>, 47, prints, as preserved
at Bridgewater House, two undated letters from Daniel to Sir Thomas
Egerton. One, intended to suggest that Shakespeare was a rival
candidate for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span> post in the Queen’s Revels, is a forgery, and this
makes it impossible to attach much credit to the other, in which the
writer mentions the ‘preferment of my brother’ and that he himself has
‘bene constrayned to live with children’. Moreover, the manuscript was
not forthcoming in 1861 (Ingleby, 247, 307). Daniel evidently took a
part in the management of the Revels company; the indiscretion of his
<i>Philotas</i> did not prevent him from acting as payee for their
plays of 1604–5. But his connexion with them probably ceased when
<i>Eastward Ho!</i> led, later in 1605, to the withdrawal of Anne’s
patronage. The irrepressible Mr. Fleay (i. 110) thinks that they then
satirized him as Damoetas in Day’s <i>Isle of Gulls</i> (1606). Daniel
wrote one more mask and two pastorals, all for Court performances.
By 1607 he was Groom of Anne’s Privy Chamber, and by 1613 Gentleman
Extraordinary of the same Chamber. In 1615 his brother John obtained
through his influence a patent for the Children of the Queen’s Chamber
of Bristol (cf. ch. xii). He is said to have had a wife Justina, who
was probably the sister of John Florio, whom he called ‘brother’ in
1611. The suggestion of Bolton Corney (<i>3 N. Q.</i> viii. 4, 40, 52)
that this only meant fellow servant of the Queen is not plausible;
this relation would have been expressed by ‘fellow’. He had a house
in Old Street, but kept up his Somerset connexion, and was buried at
Beckington, where he had a farm named Ridge, in Oct. 1619.</p>

<p>The play is in the classical manner, with choruses. From the Apology,
motived by ‘the wrong application and misconceiving’ of it, I extract:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘Above eight yeares since [1596], meeting with my deare friend
D. Lateware, (whose memory I reverence) in his Lords Chamber
and mine, I told him the purpose I had for <i>Philotas</i>:
who sayd that himselfe had written the same argument, and
caused it to be presented in St. John’s Colledge in Oxford;
where as I after heard, it was worthily and with great applause
performed.... And living in the Country, about foure yeares
since, and neere halfe a yeare before the late Tragedy of ours
(whereunto this is now most ignorantly resembled) unfortunately
fell out heere in England [Sept., 1600], I began the same,
and wrote three Acts thereof,&mdash;as many to whom I then shewed
it can witnesse,&mdash;purposing to have had it presented in Bath
by certaine Gentlemens sonnes, as a private recreation for
the Christmas, before the Shrovetide of that unhappy disorder
[Feb. 1601]. But by reason of some occasion then falling out,
and being called upon by my Printer for a new impression of my
workes, with some additions to the Civill Warres, I intermitted
this other subject. Which now lying by mee, and driven by
necessity to make use of my pen, and the Stage to bee the
mouth of my lines, which before were never heard to speake
but in silence, I thought the representing so true a History,
in the ancient forme of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span> a Tragedy, could not but have had
an unreproveable passage with the time, and the better sort
of men; seeing with what idle fictions, and grosse follies,
the Stage at this day abused mens recreations.... And for any
resemblance, that thorough the ignorance of the History may be
applied to the late Earle of Essex, it can hold in no proportion
but only in his weaknesses, which I would wish all that love
his memory not to revive. And for mine owne part, having beene
perticularly beholding to his bounty, I would to God his errors
and disobedience to his Sovereigne might be so deepe buried
underneath the earth, and in so low a tombe from his other
parts, that hee might never be remembered among the examples
of disloyalty in this Kingdome, or paraleld with Forreine
Conspirators.’</p>
</div>

<p class="p-left">The Apology is fixed by its own data to the autumn of
1604, and the performance was pretty clearly by the Queen’s Revels in
the same year. Daniel was called before the Privy Council on account of
the play, and used the name of the Earl of Devonshire in his defence.
The earl was displeased and a letter of excuse from Daniel is extant
(Grosart, i. xxii, from <i>S. P. D. Jac. I, 1603–10</i>, p. 18) in
which, after asserting that he had satisfied Lord Cranborne [Robert
Cecil], he says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘First I tolde the Lordes I had written 3 Acts of this tragedie
the Christmas before my L. of Essex troubles, as diuers in the
cittie could witnes. I saide the maister of the Revells had
pervsed it. I said I had read some parte of it to your honour,
and this I said having none els of powre to grace mee now in
Corte &amp; hoping that you out of your knowledg of bookes, or
fauour of letters &amp; mee, might answere that there is nothing
in it disagreeing nor any thing, as I protest there is not,
but out of the vniuersall notions of ambition and envie, the
perpetuall argumentes of books or tragedies. I did not say you
incouraged me vnto the presenting of it; yf I should I had beene
a villayne, for that when I shewd it to your honour I was not
resolud to haue had it acted, nor should it haue bene had not my
necessities ouermaistred mee.’</p>

<p>Robert Ker, Lord Roxborough, was married to Jean Drummond, daughter
of Patrick, third Lord Drummond, and long a lady of Anne’s household.
The wedding was originally fixed for 6 Jan. 1614, and the Queen meant
to celebrate it with ‘a masque of maids, if they may be found’ (Birch,
i. 279). It was, however, put off until Candlemas, doubtless to avoid
competition with Somerset’s wedding, and appears from the dedication
also to have served for a house-warming, to which Anne invited James
on the completion of some alterations to Somerset House. Finett
(<i>Philoxenis</i>, 16), who describes the complications caused by an
invitation to the French ambassador, gives the date as 2 Feb., which is
in itself the more probable; but John Chamberlain gives 3 Feb., unless
there is an error in the dating of the two letters to Carleton, cited
by Greg from <i>Addl. MS.</i> 4173, ff. 368, 371, as of 3 and 10 Feb.
In the first he writes, ‘This day the Lord of Roxburgh marries M<sup>rs</sup>.
Jane Drummond at Somerset House, whither the King is invited to lie
this night; &amp; shall be entertained with shews &amp; devices, specially a
Pastoral, that shall be represented in a little square paved Court’;
and in the second, ‘This day sevennight the Lord of Roxburgh married
M<sup>rs</sup>. Jane Drummond at Somerset House or Queen’s Court (as it must
now be called). The King tarried there till Saturday after dinner. The
Entertainment was great, &amp; cost the Queen, as she says, above 3000£.
The Pastoral made by Samuel Daniel was solemn &amp; dull; but perhaps
better to be read than represented.’ Gawdy, 175, also mentions the
‘pastoral’. There is nothing to show who were the performers.</p>

publication was motived by ‘the unmannerly presumption of an indiscreet
Printer, who without warrant hath divulged the late shewe ... and the
same very disorderly set forth’. Lady Bedford had ‘preferred’ Daniel to
the Queen ‘in this imployment’.]</p>

<p><i>Editions</i> by Nichols, <i>James</i>, i. 305 (1828), E. Law (1880),
and H. A. Evans (1897, <i>English Masques</i>).</p>

<p>The maskers, in various colours and with appropriate emblems, were
twelve Goddesses, and were attended by torchbearers (cf. Carleton,
<i>infra</i>); the presenters, ‘for the introducing this show’, Night,
Sleep, Iris, Sibylla, and the Graces; the cornets, Satyrs.</p>

<p>The locality was the Hall at Hampton Court. At the lower end was a
mountain, from which the maskers descended, and in which the cornets
played; at the upper end the cave of Sleep and, on the left (Carleton),
a temple of Peace, in the cupola of which was ‘the consort music’,
while viols and lutes were ‘on one side of the hall’.</p>

<p>The maskers presented their emblems, which Sibylla laid upon the altar
of the temple. They danced ‘their own measures’, then took out the
lords for ‘certain measures, galliards, and corantoes’, and after a
‘short departing dance’ reascended the mountain.</p>

<p>This was a Queen’s mask, danced, according to manuscript notes in a
copy of the Allde edition (B.M. 161, a. 41) thought by Mr. Law to
be ‘in a hand very like Lord Worcester’s’ (<i>vide infra</i>), and
possibly identical with the ‘original MS. of this mask’ from which the
same names are given in Collier, i. 347, by the Queen (Pallas), the
Countesses of Suffolk (Juno), Hertford (Diana), Bedford (Vesta), Derby
(Proserpine), and Nottingham (Concordia), and the Ladies Rich (Venus),
Hatton (Macaria), Walsingham (Astraea), Susan Vere (Flora), Dorothy
Hastings (Ceres), and Elizabeth Howard (Tethys).</p>

<p>Anticipations of masks at Court during the winter of 1603–4 are to
be found in letters to Lord Shrewsbury from Arabella Stuart on 18
Dec. (Bradley, ii. 193), ‘The Queene intendeth to make a Mask this
Christmas, to which end my Lady of Suffolk and my Lady Walsingham hath
warrants to take of the late Queenes best apparell out of the Tower at
theyr discretion. Certain Noblemen (whom I may not yet name to you,
because some of them have made me of theyr counsell) intend another.
Certain gentlemen of good sort another’; from Cecil on 23 Dec. (Lodge,
iii. 81), ‘masks and much more’; and from Sir Thomas Edmondes on 23
Dec. (Lodge, iii. 83):</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘Both the King’s and Queen’s Majesty have a humour to have some

the young lords and chief gentlemen of one part, and the Queen

accomplishment and furnishing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span> thereof; and, because there is

to direct the order and course for the ladies’;</p>
</div>

<p class="p-left">also in the letters of Carleton to Chamberlain on 27 Nov.
(Birch, i. 24; <i>Hardwicke Papers</i>, i. 383), ‘many plays and shows

Daniel, had been of the Wilton household (cf. Aubrey, i. 311) and may
well have lent him his aid.</p>

<p>The masks of lords on 1 Jan. and of Scots on 6 Jan. are not preserved.
The latter is perhaps most memorable because Ben Jonson and his friend
Sir John Roe were thrust out from it by the Lord Chamberlain (cf. ch.
vi). Arabella Stuart briefly told Shrewsbury on 10 Jan. that there were
three masks (Bradley, ii. 199). <i>Wilbraham’s Journal</i> (<i>Camden
Misc.</i> x), 66, records:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="p-left">‘manie plaies and daunces with swordes: one mask by English
and Scottish lords: another by the Queen’s Maiestie and eleven
more ladies of her chamber presenting giftes as goddesses.

aparells: rare musick, fine songes: and in jewels most riche
20000<sup>l</sup>, the lest to my judgment: and her Maiestie 100,000<sup>l</sup>.
After Christmas was running at the ring by the King and 8 or
9 lordes for the honour of those goddesses and then they all
feasted together privatelie.’</p>
</div>

<p class="p-left">But the fullest description was given by Carleton to
Chamberlain on 15 Jan. (<i>S. P. D. Jac. I</i>, vi. 21, printed by Law,

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘On New yeares night we had a play of Robin goode-fellow

Peter Van Lore, but that is more than euery man knew and it made
a faire shew to the French Ambassadors eye whose master would
have bin well pleased with such a maskers present but not at
that prise. The rest in theyr order deliuered theyr scutchins
with letters and there was no great stay at any of them saue
only at one who was putt to the interpretacion of his deuise. It
was a faire horse colt in a faire greene field which he meant
to be a colt of Busephalus race and had this virtu of his sire
that none could mount him but one as great at lest as Alexander.
The King made himself merry with threatening to send this colt
to the stable and he could not breake loose till he promised to
dance as well as Bankes his horse. The first measure was full
of changes and seemed confused but was well gone<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span> through with
all, and for the ordinary measures they tooke out the Queen,
the ladies of Derby, Harford, Suffolke, Bedford, Susan Vere,
Suthwell th’ elder and Rich. In the corantoes they ran over
some other of the young ladies, and so ended as they began with
a song; and that done, the magicien dissolved his enchantment,
and made the maskers appear in theyr likenes to be th’ Erle of
Pembroke, the Duke, Mons<sup>r</sup>. d’Aubigny, yong Somerset, Philip
Harbert the young Bucephal, James Hayes, Richard Preston,
and Sir Henry Godier. Theyr attire was rich but somewhat too
heavy and cumbersome for dancers which putt them besides ther
galliardes. They had loose robes of crimsen sattin embrodered
with gold and bordered with brood siluer laces, dublets and
bases of cloth of siluer; buskins, swordes and hatts alike and
in theyr hats ech of them an Indian bird for a fether with
some jewells. The twelfe-day the French Ambassador was feasted
publikely; and at night there was a play in the Queens presence
with a masquerado of certaine Scotchmen who came in with a sword
dance not vnlike a matachin, and performed it clenly.... The
Sunday following was the great day of the Queenes maske.’</p>
</div>

<p class="p-left">This Carleton describes at length; I only note points
which supplement Daniel’s description.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘The Hale was so much lessened by the workes that were in it,
so as none could be admitted but men of apparance, the one end
was made into a rock and in several places the waightes placed;
in attire like savages. Through the midst from the top came a
winding stayre of breadth for three to march; and so descended
the maskers by three and three; which being all seene on the
stayres at once was the best presentacion I have at any time
seene. Theyre attire was alike, loose mantles and petticotes but
of different colors, the stuffs embrodered sattins and cloth
of gold and silver, for which they were beholding to Queen
Elizabeth’s wardrobe.... Only Pallas had a trick by herself for
her clothes were not so much below the knee, but that we might
see a woman had both feete and legs which I never knew before.’</p>
</div>

<p class="p-left">He describes the torchbearers as pages in white satin
loose gowns, although Daniel says they were ‘in the like several
colours’ to the maskers. The temple was ‘on the left side of the hall
towards the upper end’. For the ‘common measures’ the lords taken out
were Pembroke, Lennox, Suffolk, Henry Howard, Southampton, Devonshire,
Sidney, Nottingham, Monteagle, Northumberland, Knollys, and Worcester.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘For galliardes and corantoes they went by discretion, and the
yong Prince was tost from hand to hand like a tennis bal. The
Lady Bedford and Lady Susan tooke owt the two ambassadors; and
they bestirred themselfe very liuely: speceally the Spaniard for
the Spanish galliard shewed himself a lusty old reueller.... But
of all for goode grace and goode footmanship Pallas bare the
bell away.’</p>
</div>

<p>The dancers unmasked about midnight, and then came a banquet in the
presence-chamber, ‘which was dispatched with the accustomed confusion’.</p>

<p>Carleton also mentions the trouble between the Spanish and French
ambassadors, which is also referred to in a letter of O. Renzo to G.
A. Frederico (<i>S. P. D. Jac. I</i>, vi. 37; cf. Sullivan, 195), and
is the subject of several dispatches by and to the Comte de Beaumont<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>
(<i>King’s MSS.</i> cxxiv, ff. 328, 359<sup>v</sup>, 363, 373, 381, 383<sup>v</sup>, 389;
cf. Reyher, 519, Sullivan, 193–5). was the object of the Court not
to invite both ambassadors together, as this would entail an awkward
decision as to precedence. Beaumont was asked first, to the mask on 1
Jan. He hesitated to accept, expressing a fear that it was intended to
ask De Taxis to the Queen’s mask on Twelfth Night, ‘dernier jour des
festes de Noël selon la facon d’Angleterre et le plus honnorable de
tout pour la cérémonie qui s’y obserue de tout temps publiquement’.
After some negotiation he extracted a promise from James that, if the
Spaniard was present at all, it would be in a private capacity, and he
then dropped the point, and accepted his own invitation, threatening to
kill De Taxis in the presence if he dared to dispute precedence with
him. On 5 Jan. he learnt that Anne had refused to dance if De Taxis was
not present, and that the promise would be broken. He protested, and
his protest was met by an invitation for the Twelfth Night to which he
had attached such importance. But the Queen’s mask was put off until
8 Jan., a Scottish mask substituted on 6 Jan., and on 8 Jan. De Taxis
was present, revelling it in red, while Anne paid him the compliment of
wearing a red favour on her costume.</p>

<p>Reyher, 519, cites references to the Queen’s mask in the accounts
of the Treasurer of the Chamber and of the Office of Works. E. Law
(<i>Hist. of Hampton Court</i>, ii. 10) gives, presumably from one of
these, ‘making readie the lower ende with certain roomes of the hall at
Hampton Court for the Queenes Maiestie and ladies against their mask by
the space of three dayes’.</p>

<p>Allde’s edition must have been quickly printed. On 2 Feb. Lord
Worcester wrote to Lord Shrewsbury (Lodge, iii. 87): ‘Whereas your
Lordship saith you were never particularly advertised of the mask, I
have been at sixpence charge with you to send you the book, which will
inform you better than I can, having noted the names of the ladies
applied to each goddess; and for the other, I would likewise have sent
you the ballet, if I could have got it for money, but these books, as
I hear, are all called in, and in truth I will not take upon me to set
that down which wiser than myself do not understand.’</p>



<p class="center p1"><i>Tethys’ Festival. 5 June 1610</i></p>

<p>1610. Tethys Festiual: or the Queenes Wake. Celebrated at Whitehall,
the fifth day of June 1610. Deuised by Samuel Daniel, one of the
Groomes of her Maiesties most Honourable priuie Chamber. <i>For John
Budge.</i> [Annexed with separate title-page to <i>The Creation of
Henry Prince of Wales</i> (q.v.). A Preface to the Reader criticizes,
though not by name, Ben Jonson’s descriptions of his masks.]</p>

<p><i>Edition</i> in Nichols, <i>James</i> (1828), ii. 346.</p>

<p>The maskers, in sky-blue and cloth of silver, were Tethys and thirteen
Nymphs of as many English Rivers; the antimaskers, in light robes
adorned with flowers, eight Naiads; the presenters Zephyrus and two
Tritons, whom with the Naiads Daniel calls ‘the Ante-maske or first
shew’, and Mercury. Torchbearers were dispensed with, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span> ‘they would
have pestered the roome, which the season would not well permit’.</p>

<p>The locality was probably the Banqueting Room at Whitehall. The scene
was supplemented by a Tree of Victory on a mount to the right of ‘the
state’. A ‘travers’ representing a cloud served for a curtain, and was
drawn to discover, within a framework borne on pilasters, in front
of which stood Neptune and Nereus on pedestals, a haven, whence the
‘Ante-maske’ issued. They presented on behalf of Tethys a trident to
the King, and a sword and scarf to Henry, and the Naiads danced round
Zephyrus. The scene was then changed, under cover of three circles of
moving lights and glasses, to show five niches, of which the central
one represented a throne for Tethys, with Thames at her feet, and the
others four caverns, each containing three Nymphs.</p>

<p>The maskers marched to the Tree of Victory, at which they offered their
flowers, and under which Tethys reposed between the dances. Of these
they gave two; then took out the Lords for ‘measures, corantos, and
galliardes’; and then gave their ‘retyring daunce’. Apparently as an
innovation, ‘to avoid the confusion which usually attendeth the desolve
of these shewes’, the presenters stayed the dissolve, and Mercury sent
the Duke of York and six young noblemen to conduct the Queen and ladies
back ‘in their owne forme’.</p>

<p>This was a Queen’s mask, and Daniel notes ‘that there were none of
inferior sort mixed among these great personages of state and honour
(as usually there have been); but all was performed by themselves
with a due reservation of their dignity. The maskers were the
Queen (Tethys), the Lady Elizabeth (Thames), Lady Arabella Stuart
(Trent), the Countesses of Arundel (Arun), Derby (Darwent), Essex
(Lee), Dorset (Air), and Montgomery (Severn), Viscountess Haddington
(Rother), and the Ladies Elizabeth Gray (Medway), Elizabeth Guilford
(Dulesse), Katherine Petre (Olwy), Winter (Wye), and Windsor (Usk).
The antimaskers were ‘eight little Ladies’. The Duke of York played
Zephyrus, and two gentlemen ‘of good worth and respect’ the Tritons.
‘The artificiall part’, says Daniel, ‘only speakes Master Inago Jones.’</p>

<p>On 13 Jan. 1610 Chamberlain wrote to Winwood (iii. 117, misdated
‘February’) that ‘the Queen would likewise have a mask against
Candlemas or Shrovetide’. Doubtless it was deferred to the Creation,
for which on 24 May the same writer (Winwood, iii. 175) mentions Anne
as preparing and practising a mask. Winwood’s papers (iii. 179) also
contain a description, unsigned, but believed by their editor to be
written by John Finett, as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘The next day was graced with a most glorious Maske, which
was double. In the first, came first in the little Duke of
Yorke between two great Sea Slaves, the cheefest of Neptune’s
servants, attended upon by twelve [eight] little Ladies, all
of them the daughters of Earls or Barons. By one of these
men a speech was made unto the King and Prince, expressing
the conceipt of the maske; by the other a sword worth 20,000
crowns at the least was put into the Duke of York’s hands,
who presented the same unto the Prince his brother from the
first of those ladies which were to follow in the next maske.
This done, the Duke returned into his former<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span> place in midst
of the stage, and the little ladies performed their dance to
the amazement of all the beholders, considering the tenderness
of their years and the many intricate changes of the dance;
which was so disposed, that which way soever the changes went
the little Duke was still found to be in the midst of these
little dancers. These light skirmishers having done their
<i>devoir</i>, in came the Princesses; first the Queen, next the
Lady Elizabeth’s Grace, then the Lady Arbella, the Countesses
of Arundell, Derby, Essex, Dorset, and Montgomery, the Lady
Hadington, the Lady Elizabeth Grey, the Lady Windsor, the Lady
Katherine Peter, the Lady Elizabeth Guilford, and the Lady Mary
[Anne] Wintour. By that time these had done, it was high time
to go to bed, for it was within half an hour of the sun’s, not
setting, but rising. Howbeit, a farther time was to be spent in
viewing and scrambling at one of the most magnificent banquets
that I have seen. The ambassadors of Spaine, of Venice, and of
the Low Countries were present at this and all the rest of these
glorious sights, and in truth so they were.’</p>
</div>

<p class="p-left">Brief notices in Stowe’s <i>Annales</i> (902, paged 907
in error) and in letters by Carleton to Sir Thomas Edmondes (Birch, i.
114) and by John Noies to his wife (<i>Hist. MSS. Various Colls.</i>
iii. 261) add nothing to Finett’s account. There were no very serious
ambassadorial complications, as the death of Henri IV put an invitation
to the French ambassador out of the question (cf. Sullivan, 59). Correr
notes with satisfaction that, as ambassador from Venice, he had as
good a box as that of the Spanish ambassador, while, to please Spanish
susceptibilities, that of the Dutch ambassador was less good (<i>V.
P.</i> xi. 507).</p>

<p>The mask was ‘excessively costly’ (<i>V. P.</i> xii. 86). Several
financial documents relating to it are on record (Reyher, 507, 521;
Devon, 105, 127; Sullivan, 219, 221; <i>S. P. D. Jac. I</i>, liii.
4, 74; lix. 12), including a warrant of 4 March, which recites the
Queen’s pleasure that the Lord Chamberlain and Master of the Horse
‘shall take some paines to look into the emptions and provisions of all
things necessarie’, another of 25 May for an imprest to Inigo Jones,
an embroiderer’s bill for £55, and a silkman’s for £1,071 5<i>s.</i>,
with an endorsement by Lord Knyvet, referring the prices to the Privy
Council, and counter-signatures by the Lord Chamberlain and the Master
of the Horse. In this case the dresses of the maskers seem to have
been provided for them. An allusion in a letter of Donne to Sir Henry
Goodyere (<i>Letters</i>, i. 240) makes a sportive suggestion for a
source of revenue ‘if Mr. Inago Jones be not satisfied for his last
masque (because I hear say it cannot come to much)’.</p>

<p>This was in intelligent anticipation of events. Edinburgh Castle was
held by Kirkcaldy of Grange for Mary in 1571. On 28 May 1573 it was
taken by the English on behalf of the party of James VI, and Kirkcaldy
was hanged.</p>

<p class="p-left p2">JOHN DAY (<i>c.</i> 1574–<i>c.</i> 1640).</p>

<p>Day was described as son of Walter Dey, husbandman, of Cawston,
Norfolk, when at the age of eighteen he became a sizar of Gonville
and Caius, Cambridge, on 24 Oct. 1592; on 4 May 1593 he was expelled
for stealing a book (Venn, <i>Caius</i>, i. 146). He next appears in
Henslowe’s diary, first as selling an old play for the Admiral’s in
July 1598, and then as writing busily for that company in 1599–1603
and for Worcester’s in 1602–3. Most of this work was in collaboration,
occasionally with Dekker, frequently with Chettle, Hathway, Haughton,
or Smith. From this period little or nothing survives except <i>The
Blind Beggar of Bethnal Green</i>. Greg, <i>Henslowe Papers</i>, 126,
doubts whether an acrostic on Thomas Downton signed ‘John Daye’,
contributed by J. F. Herbert to <i>Sh. Soc. Papers</i>, i. 19, and
now at Dulwich, is to be ascribed to the dramatist. Day’s independent
plays, written about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span> 1604–8, and his <i>Parliament of Bees</i> are of
finer literary quality than this early record would suggest. But Ben
Jonson classed him to Drummond in 1619 amongst the ‘rogues’ and ‘base
fellows’ who were ‘not of the number of the faithfull, i.e. Poets’
(Laing, 4, 11). He must have lived long, as John Tatham, who included
an elegy on him as his ‘loving friend’ in his <i>Fancies Theater</i>
(1640), was then only about twenty-eight. He appears to have been
still writing plays in 1623, but there is no trace of any substantial
body of work after 1608. Fleay, i. 115, suggests from the tone of his
manuscript pamphlet <i>Peregrinatio Scholastica</i> that he took orders.</p>

<p>The Prince’s men of the title are probably the later Prince Charles’s
(1631–41), but these were the ultimate successors of Prince Henry’s,
formerly the Admiral’s, who produced, between May 1600 and Sept. 1601,
three parts of a play called indifferently by Henslowe <i>The Blind
Beggar of Bethnal Green</i> and <i>Thomas Strowd</i>. Payments were
made for the first part to Day and Chettle and for the other two to Day
and Haughton. On the assumption that the extant play is Part i, Bullen,
<i>Introd.</i> 8 and Fleay, i. 107, make divergent suggestions as to
the division of responsibility between Day and Chettle. At l. 2177 is
the s.d. ‘Enter Captain Westford, Sill Clark’; probably the performance
in which this actor took part was a Caroline one.</p>

<p>The name given to the company suggests that the play was on the stage
in 1605–6. But I think the original production must have been in 1604,
as the dispute between Westminster and Winchester for ‘terms’, in which
Winchester is said to have been successful, ‘on Saint Lukes day, coming
shalbe a twelue-month’ (ed. Bullen, p. 61)<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span> can only refer to the term
held at Winchester in 1603. An inundation in July is also mentioned (p.
61), and Stowe, <i>Annales</i> (1615), 844, has a corresponding record
for 1604, but gives the day as 3 Aug.</p>

<p>1606. <i>For John Trundle, sold by John Hodgets.</i></p>

<p>1633. <i>For William Sheares.</i></p>

<p>The play is thus referred to by Sir Edward Hoby in a letter of 7 March
1606 to Sir Thomas Edmondes (Birch, i. 59): ‘At this time (<i>c.</i>
15 Feb.) was much speech of a play in the Black Friars, where, in the
“Isle of Gulls”, from the highest to the lowest, all men’s parts were
acted of two divers nations: as I understand sundry were committed
to Bridewell.’ A passage in iv. 4 (Bullen, p. 91), probably written
with <i>Eastward Ho!</i> in mind, refers to the ‘libelling’ ascribed
to poets by ‘some Dor’ and ‘false informers’; and the Induction
defends the play itself against the charge that a ‘great mans life’ is
‘charactred’ in Damoetas. Nevertheless, Damoetas, the royal favourite,
‘a little hillock made great with others ruines’ (p. 13) inevitably
suggests Sir Robert Carr, and Fleay, i. 109, points out that the ‘Duke’
and ‘Duchess’ of the dramatis personae have been substituted for a
‘King’ and ‘Queen’. It may not be possible now to verify all the men
whose ‘parts’ were acted; evidently the Arcadians and Lacedaemonians
stand for the two ‘nations’ of English and Scotch. I do not see any
ground for Fleay’s attempt to treat the play, not as a political, but
as a literary satire, identifying Damoetas with Daniel, and tracing
allusions to Jonson, Marston, and Chapman in the Induction. Hoby’s
indication of date is confirmed by references to the ‘Eastward,
Westward or Northward hoe’ (p. 3; cf. s.vv. Chapman, Dekker), to the
quartering for treason on 30 Jan. 1606 (pp. 3, 51), and conceivably to
Jonson’s <i>Volpone</i> of 1605 or early 1606 (p. 88, ‘you wil ha my

<p>The date must be taken as 1607–8, since the King’s Revels are not
traceable before 1607. Fleay, i. 111, notes a reference in iii. 4 to
the ‘great frost’ of that Christmas. The Epistle speaks of the play
as ‘sufficiently featur’d too, had it been all of one man’s getting’,
which may be a hint of divided authorship.</p>

<p>This is neither a play nor a mask, but a set of twelve short
‘Characters’ or ‘Colloquies’ in dialogue. The existence of an edition
of 1607 is asserted in Gildon’s abridgement (1699) of Langbaine, but
cannot be verified, and is most improbable, since the manuscript
Epistle refers to an earlier work already dedicated by Day, as ‘an
unknowing venturer’, to Augustine, and this must surely be the
allegorical treatise <i>Peregrinatio Scholastica</i> printed by Bullen
(<i>Introd.</i> 35) from <i>Sloane MS.</i> 3150 with an Epistle by Day
to William Austin, who may reasonably be identified with Augustine. But
the <i>Peregrinatio</i>, although Day’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span> first venture in dedication,
was not a very early work, for Day admits that ‘I boast not that
gaudie spring of credit and youthfull florish of opinion as some other
filde in the same rancke with me’. Moreover, it describes (p. 50) an
‘ante-maske’, and this term, so far as we know, first came into use
about 1608 (cf. ch. vi). The <i>Bees</i> therefore must be later still.
On the other hand, it can hardly be later than about 1616, when died
Philip Henslowe, whom it is impossible to resist seeing with Fleay, i.
115, in the Fenerator or Usuring Bee (p. 63). Like Henslowe he is a
‘broaker’ and ‘takes up’ clothes; and</p>

<p class="p-left">Now of the twelve Characters of the <i>Bees</i>, five
(2, 3, 7, 8, 9) are reproduced, in many parts verbatim, subject to an
alteration of names, in <i>The Wonder of a Kingdom</i>, printed as
Dekker’s (q.v.) in 1636, but probably identical with <i>Come See a
Wonder</i>, licensed by Herbert as Day’s in 1623. Two others (4, 5) are
similarly reproduced in <i>The Noble Soldier</i>, printed in 1634 under
the initials ‘S. R.’, probably indicating Samuel Rowley, but possibly
also containing work by Dekker. The precise relation of Day to these
plays is indeterminate, but the scenes more obviously ‘belong’ to the
<i>Bees</i> than to the plays, and if the <i>Bees</i> was written but
not printed in 1608–16, the chances are that Day used it as a quarry of
material when he was called upon to work, as reviser or collaborator,
on the plays. Meanwhile, Austin, if he was the Southwark and Lincoln’s
Inn writer of that name (<i>D. N. B.</i>), died in 1634, and when the
<i>Bees</i> was ultimately printed in 1641 a new dedicatee had to be
found.</p>



<p class="center p1"><i>Lost and Doubtful Plays</i></p>

<p>For the Admiral’s, 1598–1603.</p>

<p>Day appears to have sold the company an old play <i>1 The Conquest
of Brute</i> in July 1598, and to have subsequently written or
collaborated in the following plays:</p>

<p>1599–1600: <i>Cox of Collumpton</i>, with Haughton; <i>Thomas
Merry</i>, or <i>Beech’s Tragedy</i>, with Haughton; <i>The Seven
Wise Masters</i>, with Chettle, Dekker, and Haughton; <i>Cupid and
Psyche</i>, with Chettle and Dekker; <i>1 Blind Beggar of Bethnal
Green</i>, with Chettle; and the unfinished <i>Spanish Moor’s
Tragedy</i>, with Dekker and Haughton.</p>

<p>1600–1: <i>2 Blind Beggar of Bethnal Green</i>, with Haughton; <i>Six
Yeomen of the West</i>, with Haughton.</p>

<p>1601–2: <i>The Conquest of the West Indies</i>, with Haughton and
Smith; <i>3 Blind Beggar of Bethnal Green</i>, with Haughton; <i>Friar
Rush and The Proud Woman of Antwerp</i>, with Chettle and Haughton;
<i>The Bristol Tragedy</i>; and the unfinished <i>2 Tom Dough</i>, with
Haughton.</p>

<p>1602–3: <i>Merry as May Be</i>, with Hathway and Smith; <i>The Boss of
Billingsgate</i>, with Hathway and another.</p>

<p class="p1">For Worcester’s men.</p>

<p>1602–3: <i>1 and 2 The Black Dog of Newgate</i>, with Hathway, Smith,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>
and another; <i>The Unfortunate General</i>, with Hathway, Smith, and a
third; and the unfinished <i>Shore</i>, with Chettle.</p>

<p>Of the above only <i>The Blind Beggar of Bethnal Green</i> and a note
of <i>Cox of Collumpton</i> (cf. ch. xiii, s.v. Admiral’s) survive;
for speculations as to others see Heywood, <i>Pleasant Dialogues and
Dramas</i> (<i>Cupid and Psyche</i>), Marlowe, <i>Lust’s Dominion</i>
(<i>Spanish Moor’s Tragedy</i>), Yarington, <i>Two Lamentable
Tragedies</i> (<i>Thomas Merry</i>), and the anonymous <i>Edward IV</i>
(<i>Shore</i>) and <i>Fair Maid of Bristol</i> (<i>Bristow Tragedy</i>).</p>

<p>Henslowe’s correspondence (<i>Henslowe Papers</i>, 56, 127) contains
notes from Day and others about some of the Admiral’s plays and a few
lines which may be from <i>The Conquest of the Indies</i>.</p>

<p>Day’s <i>Mad Pranks of Merry Mall of the Bankside</i> (S. R. 7 Aug.
1610) was probably a pamphlet (cf. Dekker, <i>The Roaring Girl</i>).
Bullen, <i>Introd.</i> 11, thinks the <i>Guy Earl of Warwick</i>
(1661), printed as ‘by B. J.’, too bad to be Day and Dekker’s <i>Life
and Death of Guy of Warwick</i> (S. R. 15 Jan. 1620). On 30 July 1623
Herbert licensed a <i>Bellman of Paris</i> by Day and Dekker for the
Prince’s (Herbert, 24). <i>The Maiden’s Holiday</i> by Marlowe (q.v.)
and Day (S. R. 8 April 1654) appears in Warburton’s list of burnt plays
(<i>3 Library</i>, ii. 231) as Marlowe’s.</p>

<p>For other ascriptions to Day see <i>The Maid’s Metamorphosis</i> and
<i>Parnassus</i> in ch. xxiv.</p>


<p class="p-left p2">THOMAS DEKKER (<i>c.</i> 1572–<i>c.</i> 1632).</p>

<p>Thomas Dekker was of London origin, but though the name occurs in
Southwark, Cripplegate, and Bishopsgate records, neither his parentage
nor his marriage, if he was married, can be definitely traced. He
was not unlettered, but nothing is known of his education, and the
conjecture that he trailed a pike in the Netherlands is merely based on
his acquaintance with war and with Dutch. The Epistle to his <i>English
Villanies</i>, with its reference to ‘my three score years’, first
appeared in the edition of 1632; he was therefore born about 1572. He
first emerges, in Henslowe’s diary, as a playwright for the Admiral’s
in 1598, and may very well have been working for them during 1594–8,
a period for which Henslowe records plays only and not authors. The
further conjecture of Fleay, i. 119, that this employment went as
far back as 1588–91 is hazardous, and in fact led Fleay to put his
birth-date as far back as 1567. It was based on the fact that the
German repertories of 1620 and 1626 contain traces of his work, and
on Fleay’s erroneous belief (cf. ch. xiv) that all the plays in these
repertories were taken to Germany by Robert Browne as early as 1592.
But it is smiled upon by Greg (<i>Henslowe</i>, ii. 256) as regards
<i>The Virgin Martyr</i> alone. Between 1598 and 1602 Dekker wrote
busily, and as a rule in collaboration, first for the Admiral’s at
the Rose and Fortune, and afterwards for Worcester’s at the Rose.
He had a hand in some forty-four plays, of which, in anything like
their original form, only half a dozen survive. <i>Satiromastix</i>,
written for the Chamberlain’s men and the Paul’s boys in 1601, shows
that his activities were not limited to the Henslowe companies. This<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>
intervention in the <i>Poetomachia</i> led Jonson to portray him as
Demetrius Fannius ‘the dresser of plays’ in <i>The Poetaster</i>; that
he is also Thersites in <i>Troilus and Cressida</i> is a not very
plausible conjecture. Long after, in 1619, Jonson classed him among
the ‘rogues’ (Laing, 4). In 1604, however, he shared with Jonson the
responsibility for the London devices at James’s coronation entry.
About this time began his career as a writer of popular pamphlets, in
which he proved the most effective successor of Thomas Nashe. These,
and in particular <i>The Gull’s Hornbook</i> (1609), are full of
touches drawn from his experience as a dramatist. Nor did he wholly
desert the stage, collaborating with Middleton for the Prince’s and
with Webster for Paul’s, and writing also, apparently alone, for the
Queen’s. In 1612 he devised the Lord Mayor’s pageant. In 1613 he fell
upon evil days. He had always been impecunious, and Henslowe (i. 83,
101, 161) had lent him money to discharge him from the Counter in 1598
and from an arrest by the Chamberlain’s in 1599. Now he fell into
the King’s Bench for debt, and apparently lay there until 1619. The
relationship of his later work to that of Ford, Massinger, Day, and
others, lies rather beyond the scope of this inquiry, but in view of
the persistent attempts to find early elements in all his plays, I
have made my list comprehensive. He is not traceable after 1632, and
is probably the Thomas Decker, householder, buried at St. James’s,
Clerkenwell, on 25 Aug. 1632. A Clerkenwell recusant of this name is
recorded in 1626 and 1628 (<i>Middlesex County Records</i>, iii. 12,
19).</p>

<p>The Admiral’s revived, from 3 Feb. to 26 May 1596, ‘the 1 parte of
Forteunatus’. Nothing is heard of a second part, but during 9–30 Nov.
1599 Dekker received £6 on account of the Admiral’s for ‘the hole
history of Fortunatus’, followed on 1 Dec. by £1 for altering the
book and on 12 Dec. £2 ‘for the eande of Fortewnatus for the corte’.
The company were at Court on 27 Dec. 1599 and 1 Jan. 1600. <i>The
Shoemaker’s Holiday</i> was played on 1 Jan.; <i>Fortunatus</i>
therefore on 27 Dec. The Prologue (l. 21) makes it ‘a iust yeere’
since the speaker saw the Queen, presumably on 27 Dec. 1598. The S.
R. entry suggests that the 1599 play was a revision of the 1596 one.
Probably Dekker boiled the old two parts down into one play; the
juncture may, as suggested by Fleay, i. 126, and Greg (<i>Henslowe</i>,
ii. 179), come about l. 1315. The Court additions clearly include,
besides the Prologue and the Epilogue with its reference to Elizabeth’s
forty-second regnal year (1599–1600), the compliment of ll. 2799–834 at
the ‘eande’ of the play. The ‘small circumference’ of the theatrical
prologue was doubtless the Rose. Dekker may or may not have been
the original author of the two-part play; probably he was not, if
Fleay is right in assigning it to <i>c.</i> 1590 on the strength
of the allusions to the Marprelate controversy left in the 1600
text, e.g. l. 59. I should not wonder if Greene, who called his son
Fortunatus, were the original author. A Fortunatus play is traceable
in German repertories of 1608 and 1626 and an extant version in the
collection of 1620 owes something to Dekker’s (Herz, 97; cf. P. Harms,
<i>Die deutschen Fortunatus-Dramen</i> in <i>Theatergeschichtliche
Forschungen</i>, v). But Dekker’s own source, directly or indirectly,
was a German folk-tale, which had been dramatized by Hans Sachs as
early as 1553.</p>

<p>Henslowe advanced £3 ‘to bye a boocke called the gentle Craft of Thomas
Dickers’ on 15 July 1599. Probably the hiatus in the Diary conceals
other payments for the play, and there is nothing in the form of the
entry to justify the suspicions of Fleay, i. 124, that it was not
new and was not by Dekker himself. Moreover, the source was a prose
tract of <i>The Gentle Craft</i> by T. D[eloney], published in 1598.
The Admiral’s were at Court on 1 Jan. 1600, but not on 1 Jan. 1601. A
writer signing himself Dramaticus, in <i>Sh. Soc. Papers</i>, iv. 110,
describes a copy in which a contemporary hand has written the names
‘T. Dekker, R. Wilson’ at the end of the Epistle, together with the
names of the actors in the margin of the text. A few of these are not
otherwise traceable in the Admiral’s. Fleay and Greg (<i>Henslowe</i>,
ii. 203) unite in condemning this communication as an obvious forgery;
but I rather wish they had given their reasons.</p>

<p>Henslowe paid £10 10<i>s.</i> to Dekker, Chettle, and Haughton for
the play between 16 Oct. and 29 Dec. 1599, also £1 for Grissell’s
gown on 26 Jan. 1600 and £2 ‘to staye the printing’ on 18 March 1600.
The text refers to ‘wonders of 1599’ (l. 2220) and to ‘this yeare’
as ‘leap yeare’ (l. 157). The production was doubtless <i>c.</i>
Feb.–March 1600. Fleay, i. 271, attempts to divide the work amongst
the three contributors; cf. Hunt, 60. I see nothing to commend the
theory of W. Bang (<i>E. S.</i> xxviii. 208) that the play was written
by Chettle <i>c.</i> 1590–4 and revised with Dekker, Haughton, and
Jonson. No doubt the dandy’s duel, in which clothes alone suffer, of
Emulo-Sir Owen resembles that of Brisk-Luculento in <i>Every Man Out
of his Humour</i>, but this may be due to a common origin in fact (cf.
Fleay, i. 361; Penniman, <i>War</i>, 70; Small, 43). Fleay, followed
by Penniman, identifies Emulo with Samuel Daniel, but Small, 42, 184,
satisfactorily disposes of this suggestion. There seems no reason to
regard <i>Patient Grissell</i> as part of the <i>Poetomachia</i>.
A ‘Comoedia von der Crysella’ is in the German repertory of 1626;
the theme had, however, already been dealt with in a play of
<i>Griseldis</i> by Hans Sachs (Herz, 66, 78).</p>

(1907, <i>Materialien</i>, xx), J. H. Penniman (1913, <i>B. L.</i>).</p>

<p>The Epistle refers to the <i>Poetomachia</i> between ‘Horace’
and ‘a band of leane-witted Poetasters’, and on the place of
<i>Satiromastix</i> in this fray there is little to be added to Small,
119. Jonson is satirized as Horace. Asinius Bubo is some unknown
satellite of his, probably the same who appears as Simplicius Faber
in Marston’s <i>What You Will</i> (q.v.). Crispinus, Demetrius, and
Tucca are taken over from Jonson’s <i>Poetaster</i> (q.v.). The
satirical matter is engrafted on to a play with a tragic plot and
comic sub-plot, both wholly unconcerned with the <i>Poetomachia</i>.
Jonson must have known that the attack was in preparation, when he
made Tucca abuse Histrio for threatening to ‘play’ him, and Histrio
say that he had hired Demetrius [Dekker] ‘to abuse Horace, and bring
him in, in a play’ (<i>Poetaster</i>, <span class="allsmcap">III.</span> iv. 212, 339). But
obviously Dekker cannot have done much of his satire until he had seen
<i>Poetaster</i>, to many details of which it retorts. It is perhaps
rather fantastic to hold that, as he chaffs Jonson for the boast that
he wrote <i>Poetaster</i> in fifteen weeks (<i>Satiromastix</i>, 641),
he must himself have taken less. In any case a date of production
between that of <i>Poetaster</i> in the spring of 1601 and the S. R.
entry on 11 Nov. 1601 is indicated. The argument of Scherer, x, for
a date about Christmas 1601, and therefore after the S. R. entry, is
rebutted by Parrott. It is generally held that Marston helped Dekker
with the play, in spite of the single name on the title-page. No
doubt Tucca in <i>Poetaster</i>, <span class="allsmcap">III.</span> iv. 352, suggests to
Histrio that Crispinus shall help Demetrius, and the plural is used in
<i>Satiromastix</i> (<i>Epistle</i>, 12, and <i>Epilogue</i>, 2700) and
in Jonson’s own <i>Apologetical Dialogue</i> to <i>Poetaster</i> (l.
141) of the ‘poetasters’ who were Jonson’s ‘untrussers’. Small, 122,
finds Marston in the plot and characterization, but not in the style.</p>

<p>Henslowe, on behalf of Worcester’s men, paid Chettle, Dekker, Heywood,

properties for <i>The Overthrow of Rebels</i>, almost certainly the
same play, and began to pay Dekker for a <i>2 Lady Jane</i>, which
apparently remained unfinished, at any rate at the time. One or both of
these plays, or possibly only the shares of Dekker and Webster in one
or both of them, may reasonably be taken to survive in <i>Sir Thomas
Wyatt</i>. Stoll, 49, thinks the play, as we have it, is practically
Dekker’s and that there is ‘no one thing’ that can be claimed ‘with any
degree of assurance’ for Webster. But this is not the general view.
Fleay, ii. 269, followed in the main by Hunt, 76, gives Webster scc.
i-ix, Greg (<i>Henslowe</i>, ii. 233) scc. i-x and xvi (with hesitation
as to iii-v), Pierce, after a careful application of a number of
‘tests’ bearing both on style and on matter, scc. ii, v, vi, x, xiv,
xvi; but he thinks that some or all of these were retouched by Dekker.
Brooke inclines to trace Webster in scc. ii, xvi, Heywood in scc. vi,
x, and a good deal of Dekker. Hunt thinks the planning due to Chettle.</p>

<p>Henslowe made a payment to Dekker and Middleton for ‘the pasyent man
&amp; the onest hore’ between 1 Jan. and 14 March 1604, on account of the
Prince’s men, and the mention of Towne in a stage-direction to Part i
(ed. Pearson, ii. 78) shows that it was in fact acted by this company.
Fleay, i. 132, and Hunt, 94, cite some allusions in Part ii suggesting
a date soon after that of Part i, and this would be consistent with
Henslowian methods. There is more difference of opinion about the
partition of the work. Of Part i Fleay gives scc. i, iii, and xiii-xv
alone to Dekker, and Hunt finds the influence of Middleton in the theme
and plot of both Parts. Bullen, however (<i>Middleton</i>, i. xxv),
thinks Middleton’s share ‘inconsiderable’, giving him only <span class="allsmcap">I.</span>

<p>The play is a reply to <i>Eastward Ho!</i> which was itself a reply to
<i>Westward Ho!</i> and was on the stage before May 1605, and it is
referred to with the other two plays in Day’s <i>Isle of Gulls</i>,
which was on the stage in Feb. 1606. This pretty well fixes its date
to the end of 1605. I do not think that Stoll, 16, is justified in his
argument for a date later than Jan. 1606, since, even if the comparison
of the life of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span> gallant to a squib is a borrowing from Marston’s
<i>Fawn</i>, it seems probable that the <i>Fawn</i> itself was
originally written by 1604, although possibly touched up early in 1606.
Fleay, ii. 270, identifies Bellamont with Chapman, one of the authors
of <i>Eastward Ho!</i> and Stoll, 65, argues in support of this. It is
plausible, but does not carry with it Fleay’s identification of Jenkins
with Drayton. Fleay gives Webster <span class="allsmcap">I.</span> ii, <span class="allsmcap">II.</span> i,
<span class="allsmcap">III.</span> i, and <span class="allsmcap">IV.</span> i, but Stoll finds as little of him

Written by Thomas Dekker. <i>For N. Butter.</i> [Epistle to the Reader

<p>Fleay, i. 133, and Greg (<i>Henslowe</i>, ii. 210) regard the play as
a revision of <i>Truth’s Supplication to Candlelight</i>, for which
Henslowe, on behalf of the Admiral’s, was paying Dekker in Jan. 1600
and buying a robe for Time in April 1600. Truth and Time, but not
Candlelight, are characters in the play, which deals with Catholic
intrigues against Elizabeth, represented as Titania, and her suitors.
I do not feel sure that it would have been allowed to be staged in
Elizabeth’s lifetime. In any case it must have been revised <i>c.</i>
1605–7, in view of the references, not only to the death of Essex (ed.
Pearson, p. 246) and the reign of James (p. 234), but to the <i>Isle of
Gulls</i> of 1605 (p. 214). The Cockpit, alluded to (p. 214) as a place
where follies are shown in apes, is of course that in the palace, where
Henry saw plays. The Epistle and Prologue have clear references to a
production in ‘Fortune’s dial’ and the ‘square’ of the Fortune, and the
former criticizes players; but hardly proves the definite breach with
the Prince’s suggested by Fleay and Greg.</p>

T.</i>).</p>

<p>Fleay, i, 132, thinks the play written about 1604–5, but not produced
until 1610. This is fantastic and Bullen points out that Mary Frith,
the heroine, born not earlier than <i>c.</i> 1584–5, had hardly won her
notoriety by 1604. By 1610 she certainly had, and the ‘foule’ book of
her ‘base trickes’ referred to in the Epilogue was probably John Day’s
<i>Mad Pranks of Merry Mall of the Bankside</i>, entered on S. R.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span> 7
Aug. 1610, but not extant. The Epilogue also tells the audience that,
if they are dissatisfied,</p>

      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

<p class="p-left">I think this can only refer to a contemplated personal
appearance of Mary Frith on the stage; it has been interpreted as
referring to another forthcoming play. Moll Cutpurse appears in
Field’s <i>Amends for Ladies</i>, but this was not a Fortune play.
Bullen (<i>Middleton</i>, i. xxxv) regards the play as an example
of collaboration, and gives Dekker <span class="allsmcap">I.</span> <span class="allsmcap">II.</span> ii, and
<span class="allsmcap">V</span>; Middleton, with occasional hesitation, the rest. Fleay, i.

<p>The Epistle tells us that after ‘Fortune’ (the Admiral’s) had ‘set her
foote vpon’ the play, the Queen’s had ‘raised it up ... the Frontispice
onely a little more garnished’. Fleay, i. 133, attempts to fix the
play to 1610, but hardly proves more than that it cannot be earlier
than 14 May 1610, as the murder on that day of Henri IV is referred to
(ed. Pearson, p. 354). The Epistle also refers to a coming new play by
Dekker’s ‘worthy friend’, perhaps Webster (q.v.). In the opening scene
the devil Lurchall is addressed as Grumball, which suggests the actor
Armin (cf. ch. xv). Daborne (q.v.) in the Epistle to his <i>Christian
Turned Turk</i> seems to claim a share in this play.</p>

<p>Herbert’s diary contains the entry on 21 Aug. 1623, ‘For the L.
Elizabeth’s servants of the Cockpit. An old play called Match me in
London which had been formerly allowed by Sir G. Bucke.’ On this, some
rather slight evidence from allusions, and a general theory that Dekker
did not write plays during his imprisonment of 1613–19, Fleay, i. 134,
puts the original production by Queen Anne’s men <i>c.</i> 1611 and
Hunt, 160, in 1612–13. As there are some allusions to cards and the
game of maw, Fleay thinks the play a revision of <i>The Set at Maw</i>
produced by the Admiral’s on 15 Dec. 1594. Greg (<i>Henslowe</i>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span> ii.
172) points out the weakness of the evidence, but finds some possible
traces of revision in the text.</p>

<p>1631, 1651, 1661.</p>

<p>The play is said to have been ‘reformed’ and licensed by Buck for the
Red Bull on 6 Oct. 1620 (Herbert, 29). An additional scene, licensed
on 7 July 1624 (<i>Var.</i> i. 424), did not find its way into print.
Fleay, i. 135, 212, asserts that the 1620 play was a refashioning
by Massinger of a play by Dekker for the Queen’s about 1611, itself
a recast of <i>Diocletian</i>, produced by the Admiral’s on 16 Nov.
1594, but ‘dating from 1591 at the latest’. He considers <span class="allsmcap">II.</span>
i, iii, <span class="allsmcap">III.</span> iii, and <span class="allsmcap">IV.</span> ii of the 1620 version
to be still Dekker’s. Ward, iii. 12, and Hunt, 156, give most of
the play to Dekker. But all these views are impressionistic, and
there is no special reason to suppose that Massinger revised, rather
than collaborated with, Dekker, or to assume a version of <i>c.</i>
1611. As for an earlier version still, Fleay’s evidence is trivial.
In any case 1591 is out of the question, as Henslowe marked the
<i>Diocletian</i> of 1594 ‘n.e.’ Nor does he say it was by Dekker. A
play on Dorothea the Martyr had made its way into Germany by 1626,
but later German repertories disclose that there was also a distinct
play on Diocletian (Herz, 66, 103; Greg, <i>Henslowe</i>, ii. 172).
Greg, however, finds parts of <i>The Virgin Martyr</i>, ‘presumably
Dekker’s’, to be ‘undoubtedly early’. Oliphant (<i>E. S.</i> xvi. 191)
makes the alternative suggestion that <i>Diocletian</i> was the basis
of Fletcher’s <i>Prophetess</i>, in which he believes the latter part
of <span class="allsmcap">IV.</span> i and <span class="allsmcap">V.</span> i to be by an older hand, which he
cannot identify. All this is very indefinite.</p>

<p>I include this for the sake of completeness, but it is based upon a
pamphlet published in 1621 and was played at Court by the Prince’s men
on 29 Dec. 1621 (Murray, ii. 193). It is generally regarded as written
in collaboration. Views as to its division amongst the writers are
summarized by Hunt, 178, and Pierce (<i>Anglia</i>, xxxvi. 289). The
latter finds Dekker in nearly all the scenes, Ford in four, Rowley

they were none of the 4 companies.’ As <i>The Wonder of a Kingdom</i>
contains scenes which are obviously from Day’s <i>Parliament of
Bees</i> (<i>1608–16</i>) it is possible either to adopt the simple
theory of a collaboration between Day and Dekker in 1623, or to hold
with Fleay, i. 136, and Greg, <i>Henslowe</i>, ii. 174, that Day’s
‘new’ play of 1623 was a revision of an earlier one by Dekker. The
mention of cards in the closing lines seems an inadequate ground for
Fleay’s further theory, apparently approved by Greg, that the original
play was <i>The Mack</i>, produced by the Admiral’s on 21 Feb. 1595.</p>

<p>The play was licensed by Herbert for the Lady Elizabeth’s at the
Cockpit on 3 March 1624 (Chalmers, <i>S. A.</i> 217; Herbert, 27) and
included in a list of Cockpit plays in 1639 (<i>Variorum</i>, iii.
159). Fleay, i. 232, Ward, ii. 470, and Pierce (<i>Anglia</i>, xxxvi.
141) regard it as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span> a revision by Ford of earlier work by Dekker, and
the latter regards the last page of Act <span class="allsmcap">I</span>, Acts <span class="allsmcap">II</span>
and <span class="allsmcap">III</span>, and the prose of Acts <span class="allsmcap">IV</span> and <span class="allsmcap">V</span> as
substantially Dekker’s. It is perhaps a step from this to the theory of
Fleay and Greg (<i>Henslowe</i>, ii. 190) that the play represents the
<i>Phaethon</i>, which Dekker wrote for the Admiral’s in Jan. 1598 and
afterwards altered for a Court performance at Christmas 1600. There are
allusions to ‘humours’ and to ‘pampered jades of Asia’ (ed. Pearson,
pp. 316, 318) which look early, but Phaethon is not a character, nor
is the story his. A priest of the Sun appears in Act <span class="allsmcap">I</span>: I am
surprised that Fleay did not identify him, though he is not mad, with
the ‘mad priest of the sun’ referred to in Greene’s (q.v.) Epistle to
<i>Perimedes</i>. The play is not a ‘masque’ in the ordinary sense.</p>

<p>The initials may indicate Samuel Rowley of the Admiral’s and Prince

Rowley. But probably Day also contributed, for <span class="allsmcap">II.</span> i, ii;

Fleay, i. 128, identifies the play with <i>The Spanish Fig</i> for
which Henslowe made a payment on behalf of the Admiral’s in Jan. 1602.
This Greg (<i>Henslowe</i>, ii. 220) thinks ‘plausible’, regarding the
play as ‘certainly an old play of about 1600, presumably by Dekker and
Rowley with later additions by Day’. He notes that the King is not,
as Fleay alleged, poisoned with a Spanish fig, but a Spanish fig is
mentioned, ‘and it is quite possible that such may have been the mode
of poisoning in the original piece’. Henslowe does not name the payee

to Dekker, confident in Fleay, i. 213, and regarded as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span> possible
by Greg (<i>Henslowe</i>, ii. 165), appears to be due to the entry
of a <i>Philenzo and Hypollita</i> by Massinger, who revised other
early work of Dekker, in the S. R. on 29 June 1660, to the entry of
a <i>Philenzo and Hipolito</i> by Massinger in Warburton’s list of
burnt plays (<i>3 Library</i>, ii. 231), and to the appearance of a
<i>Julio and Hyppolita</i> in the German collection of 1620. A copy of
Massinger’s play is said (Collier, <i>Henslowe</i>, xxxi) to be amongst
the <i>Conway MSS.</i></p>

<p class="p-left ph">(ii) <i>The Jew of Venice.</i></p>

<p class="p0">Entered as a play by Dekker in the S. R. on 9 Sept. 1653 (<i>3
Library</i>, ii. 241). It has been suggested (Fleay, i. 121, and
<i>Sh.</i> 30, 197; Greg in <i>Henslowe</i>, ii. 170) that it was the
source of a German play printed from a Vienna MS. by Meissner, 131 (cf.
Herz, 84). In this a personage disguises himself as a French doctor,
which leads to the conjectural identification of its English original
both with <i>The Venetian Comedy</i> produced by the Admiral’s on 27
Aug. 1594 and with <i>The French Doctor</i> performed by the same men
on 19 Oct. 1594 and later dates and bought by them from Alleyn in
1602. The weakest point in all this guesswork is the appearance of
common themes in the German play and in <i>The Merchant of Venice</i>,
which Fleay explains to his own satisfaction by the assumption that
Shakespeare based <i>The Merchant of Venice</i> on Dekker’s work.</p>

<p>The opening of the description refers to ‘our best-to-be-beloved
friends, the noblest strangers’. John Chamberlain (Birch, i. 202) says
that the Palsgrave was present and Henry kept away by his illness,
that the show was ‘somewhat extraordinary’ and the water procession
wrecked by ‘great winds’. At Paul’s Chain the Mayor was met by the
‘first triumph’, a sea-chariot, bearing Neptune and Luna, with a
ship of wine. Neptune made a speech. At Paul’s Churchyard came ‘the
second land-triumph’, the throne or chariot of Virtue, drawn by four
horses on which sat Time, Mercury, Desire, and Industry. Virtue made
a speech, and both pageants preceded the Mayor down Cheapside. At the
little Conduit in Cheapside was the Castle of Envy, between whom and
Virtue there was a dialogue, followed by fireworks from the castle. At
the Cross in Cheapside was another ‘triumph’, the House of Fame, with
representations of famous Merchant Tailors, ‘a perticular roome being
reserved for one that represents the person of Henry, the now Prince
of Wales’. After a speech by Fame, the pageant joined the procession,
and from it was heard a song on the way to the Guildhall. On the way
to Paul’s after dinner, Virtue and Envy were again beheld, and at the
Mayor’s door a speech was made by Justice.</p>

<p class="p-left p2">MICHAEL DRAYTON (<i>c.</i> 1563–1631).</p>

<p>Drayton was born at Hartshill in Warwickshire, and brought up in the
household of Sir Henry Goodyere of Polesworth, whose daughter Anne,
afterwards Lady Rainsford, is the Idea of his pastorals and sonnets.
With <i>The Harmony of the Church</i> (1591) began a life-long series
of ambitious poems, in all the characteristic Elizabethan manners,
for which Drayton found many patrons, notably Lucy Lady Bedford, Sir
Walter Aston of Tixall, Prince Henry and Prince Charles, and Edward
Earl of Dorset. The guerdons of his pen were not sufficient to keep him
from having recourse to the stage. Meres classed him in 1598 among the
‘best for tragedy’, and Henslowe’s diary shows him a busy writer for
the Admiral’s men, almost invariably in collaboration with Dekker and
others, from Dec. 1597 to Jan. 1599, and a more occasional one from
Oct. 1599 to May 1602. At a later date he may possibly have written for
Queen Anne’s men, since commendatory verses by T. Greene are prefixed
to his <i>Poems</i> of 1605. In 1608 he belonged to the King’s Revels
syndicate at Whitefriars. No later connexion with the stage can be
traced, and he took no steps to print his plays with his other works.
His Elegy to Henry Reynolds of <i>Poets and Poesie</i> (C. Brett,
<i>Drayton’s Minor Poems</i>, 108) does honour to Marlowe, Shakespeare,
Jonson, and Beaumont, and tradition makes him a partaker in the
drinking-bout that led to Shakespeare’s end. Jonson wrote commendatory
verses for him in 1627, but in 1619 had told Drummond (Laing, 10) that
‘Drayton feared him; and he esteemed not of him’. The irresponsible
Fleay, i. 361; ii. 271, 323, identifies him with Luculento of <i>E.
M. O.</i>, Captain Jenkins of Dekker and Webster’s <i>Northward
Ho!</i>, and the eponym of the anonymous <i>Sir Giles Goosecap</i>;
Small, 98, with the Decius criticized in the anonymous <i>Jack Drum’s
Entertainment</i>, who may also be Dekker.</p>

<p>Henslowe advanced £10 to the Admiral’s as payment to Munday, Drayton,
Wilson, and Hathway for the first part of ‘the lyfe of S<sup>r</sup> Jhon
Ouldcasstell’ and in earnest for the second part on 16 Oct. 1599,
and an additional 10<i>s.</i> for the poets ‘at the playnge of S<sup>r</sup>
John Oldcastell the ferste tyme as a gefte’ between 1 and 8 Nov.
1599. Drayton had £4 for the second part between 19 and 26 Dec. 1599,
and properties were being bought for it in March 1600. It is not
preserved. By Aug. 1602 the play had been transferred to Worcester’s
men. More properties were bought, doubtless for a revival, and Dekker
had £2 10<i>s.</i> for ‘new a dicyons’. Fleay, ii. 116, attempts to
disentangle the work of the collaborators. Clearly the play was an
answer to <i>Henry IV</i>, in which Sir John Falstaff was originally
Sir John Oldcastle, and this is made clear in the prologue:</p>

<p>Edes, or Eedes, entered Christ Church, Oxford, from Westminster in
1571, took his B.A. in 1574, his M.A. in 1578, and was University
Proctor in 1583. He took orders, became Chaplain to the Queen, and
was appointed Canon of Christ Church in 1586 and Dean of Worcester
in 1597. Some of his verse, both in English and Latin, has survived,
and Meres includes him in 1598 amongst ‘our best for Tragedie’. The
Epilogue, in Latin prose, of a play called <i>Caesar Interfectus</i>,
which was both written and spoken by him, is given by F. Peck in <i>A
Collection of Curious Historical Pieces</i>, appended to his <i>Memoirs
of Cromwell</i> (1740), and by Boas, 163, from <i>Bodl. MS. Top.
Oxon.</i> e. 5, f. 359. A later hand has added the date 1582, from
which Boas infers that <i>Caesar Interfectus</i>, of which Edes was
probably the author, was one of three tragedies recorded in the Christ
Church accounts for Feb.–March 1582. Edes appears to have written or
contributed to Sir Henry Lee’s (q.v.) Woodstock Entertainment of 1592.</p>


<p class="p-left p2">RICHARD EDWARDES (<i>c.</i> 1523–1566).</p>

<p>Edwardes was a Somersetshire man. He entered Corpus Christi College,
Oxford, on 11 May 1540, and became Senior Student of Christ Church in
1547. Before the end of Edward’s reign he was seeking his fortune at
Court and had a fee or annuity of £6 13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> (Stopes,
<i>Hunnis</i>, 147). He must not be identified with the George
Edwardes of Chapel lists, <i>c.</i> 1553 (ibid. 23; <i>Shakespeare’s
Environment</i>, 238; Rimbault, x), but was of the Chapel by 1 Jan.
1557 (Nichols, <i>Eliz.</i> i. xxxv; <i>Illustrations</i>, App. 14),
when he made a New Year’s gift of ‘certeigne verses’, and was confirmed
in office by an Elizabethan patent of 27 May 1560. He succeeded Bower
as Master of the Children, receiving his patent of appointment on
27 Oct. 1561 and a commission to take up children on 4 Dec. 1561
(Wallace, i. 106; ii. 65; cf. ch. xii). Barnabe Googe in his <i>Eglogs,
Epytaphes and Sonettes</i> (15 March 1563) puts his ‘doyngs’ above
those of Plautus and Terence. In addition to plays at Court, he took
his boys on 2 Feb. 1565 and 2 Feb. 1566 to Lincoln’s Inn (cf. ch. vii),
of which he had become a member on 25 Nov. 1564 (<i>L. I. Admission
Register</i>, i. 72). He appeared at Court as a ‘post’ on behalf of
the challengers for a tilt in Nov. 1565 (cf. ch. iv). In 1566 he
helped in the entertainment of Elizabeth at Oxford, and on Oct. 31 of
that year he died. His reputation as poet and dramatist is testified
to in verses by Barnabe Googe, George Turberville, Thomas Twine, and
others and proved enduring. The author [Richard Puttenham?] of <i>The
Arte of English Poesie</i> (1589) couples him with the Earl of Oxford
as deserving the highest price for comedy and enterlude, and Francis
Meres in his <i>Palladis Tamia</i> (1598) includes him amongst those
‘best for comedy’. Several of his poems are in <i>The Paradise of
Dainty Devices</i> (1576). Warton, iv. 218, says that William Collins
(the poet) had a volume of prose stories printed in 1570, ‘sett forth
by maister Richard Edwardes mayster of her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[310]</span> maiesties revels’. One of
these contained a version of the jest used in the <i>Induction</i> of
<i>The Taming of the Shrew</i> (q.v.). There is nothing else to connect
Edwardes with the Revels office, and probably ‘revels’ in Warton’s
account is a mistake for ‘children’ or ‘chapel’.</p>

<p>The play is not divided into acts or scenes; the characters include
Carisophus a parasite, and Grim the Collier. The prologue [not that
used at Court] warns the audience that they will be ‘frustrate quite
of toying plays’ and that the author’s muse that ‘masked in delight’
and to some ‘seemed too much in young desires to range’ will leave such
sports and write a ‘tragical comedy ... mixed with mirth and care’.
Edwardes adds (cf. App. C, No. ix):</p>

  <div class="poetry-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div>Wherein, talking of courtly toys, we do protest this flat,</div>

      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

<p class="p-left">A song at the end wishes Elizabeth joy and describes
her as ‘void of all sickness, in most perfect health’. Durand uses
this reference to date the play in the early months of 1565, since a
letter of De Silva (<i>Sp. P.</i> i. 400) records that Elizabeth had
a feverish cold since 8 Dec. 1564, but was better by 2 Jan. 1565. He
identifies the play with the ‘Edwardes tragedy’ of the Revels Accounts
for 1564–5 (cf. App. B), and points out that there is an entry in
those accounts for ‘rugge bumbayst and cottone for hosse’, and that
in <i>Damon and Pythias</i> (Dodsley, iv. 71) the boys have stuffed
breeches with ‘seven ells of rug’ to one hose. A proclamation of 6 May
1562 (<i>Procl.</i> 562) had forbidden the use of more than a yard and
three-quarters of stuff in the ‘stockes’ of hose, and an enforcing
proclamation (<i>Procl.</i> 619) was required on 12 Feb. 1566. Boas,
157, notes a revival at Merton in 1568.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[311]</span></p>

<p>Fleay, 60, thinks that the play contains attacks on the Paul’s boys
in return for satire of Edwardes as Ralph Roister in Ulpian Fulwell’s
<i>Like Will to Like</i> (q.v.).</p>



<p class="center p1"><i>Lost Play</i></p>

<p class="center p1"><i>Palamon and Arcite. 1566</i></p>

<p>This play was acted in two parts on 2 and 4 Sept. 1566, before
Elizabeth in the Hall of Christ Church, Oxford (cf. ch. iv). The first
night was made memorable by the fall of part of the staircase wall,
by which three persons were killed. The Queen was sorry, but the play
went on. She gave Edwardes great thanks for his pains. The play was
in English. Several contemporary writers assign it to Edwardes, and
Nicholas Robinson adds that he and other Christ Church men translated
it out of Latin, and that he remained two months in Oxford working at
it. Bereblock gives a long analysis of the action, which shows that,
even if there is no error as to the intervening Latin version, the
original source was clearly Chaucer’s <i>Knight’s Tale</i>. W. Y.
Durand, <i>Journ. Germ. Phil.</i> iv. 356, argues that Edwardes’s play
was not a source of <i>Two Noble Kinsmen</i>, on the ground of the
divergence between that and Bereblock’s summary.</p>

<p>There is no evidence of any edition of the play, although Plummer, xxi,
says that it ‘has been several times printed’.</p>



<p class="center p1"><i>Doubtful Plays</i></p>

<p>Fleay, ii. 295, assigns to Edwardes <i>Godly Queen Hester</i>, a play
of which he had only seen a few lines, and which W. W. Greg, in his
edition in <i>Materialien</i>, v, has shown with great probability
to date from about 1525–9. His hand has also been sought in R. B.’s
<i>Apius and Virginia</i> and in <i>Misogonus</i> (cf. ch. xxiv).</p>


<p class="p-left p2">ELIZABETH (1533–1603).</p>

<p>H. H. E. Craster (<i>E. H. R.</i> xxix. 722) includes in a list of
Elizabeth’s English translations a chorus from Act <span class="allsmcap">II</span> of
the pseudo-Senecan <i>Hercules Oetaeus</i>, extant in <i>Bodl. MS. e
Museo</i>, 55, f. 48, and printed in H. Walpole, <i>Royal and Noble
Authors</i> (ed. Park, 1806), i. 102. It probably dates later than
1561. But he can find no evidence for a Latin version of a play of
Euripides referred to by Walpole, i. 85.</p>


<p class="p-left p2">RICHARD FARRANT (?-1580).</p>

<p>Farrant’s career as Master of the Children of Windsor and Deputy Master
of the Children of the Chapel and founder of the first Blackfriars
theatre has been described in chh. xii and xvii. It is not improbable
that he wrote plays for the boys, and W. J. Lawrence, <i>The Earliest
Private Theatre Play</i> (<i>T. L. S.</i>, 11 Aug. 1921), thinks that
one of these was <i>Wars of Cyrus</i> (cf. ch. xxiv), probably based
on W. Barker’s translation (1567) of Xenophon’s <i>Cyropaedia</i>,
and that the song of Panthea ascribed to Farrant in a Christ Church
manuscript (cf. vol. ii, p. 63) has dropped out from the extant text
of this. Farrant’s song, ‘O Jove from stately throne’, mentioning
Altages,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[312]</span> may be from another play. I think that <i>Wars of Cyrus</i>,
as it stands, is clearly post-<i>Tamburlaine</i>, and although there
are indications of lost songs at ll. 985, 1628, there is none pointing
to a lament of Panthea. But conceivably the play was based on one by
Farrant.</p>

in shepherds’ weeds and bagpipes, he himself like an old bard. After
that wind musique was over, they sang their pastorall eglogues
(which I have, to insert into Liber B).’ Wood’s similar account in
<i>Fasti</i> (1815), i. 270, is probably based on Aubrey’s. He dates
the entertainment June 11 (cf. ch. iv. and App. A, s. ann. 1613), and
gives the opening of the song as</p>

<p class="p-left p2">GEORGE FERRERS (<i>c.</i> 1500–79).</p>

<p>A Lincoln’s Inn lawyer, son of Thomas Ferrers of St. Albans, who
was Page of the Chamber to Henry VIII, and acted as Lord of Misrule
to Edward VI at the Christmases of 1551–2 and 1552–3 (<i>Mediaeval
Stage</i>, i. 405; Feuillerat, <i>Edw. and M.</i> 56, 77, 90). He
sat in Parliaments of both Mary and Elizabeth, and wrote some of the
poems in <i>The Mirror for Magistrates</i> (1559–78). He contributed
verses to the Kenilworth entertainment of 1575, must then have been a
very old man, and died in 1579. Puttenham says of Edward VI’s time,
‘Maister <i>Edward Ferrys</i> ... wrate for the most part to the stage,
in Tragedie and sometimes in Comedie or Enterlude’, and again, ‘For
Tragedie, the Lord of Buckhurst &amp; Maister <i>Edward Ferrys</i>, for
such doings as I haue sene of theirs, do deserue the hyest price’; and
is followed by Meres, who places ‘Master Edward Ferris, the author of
the <i>Mirror for Magistrates</i>’ amongst ‘our best for Tragedie’ (cf.
App. C, Nos. xli, lii). Obviously George Ferrers is meant, but Anthony
Wood hunted out an Edward Ferrers, belonging to another family, of
Baddesley Clinton, in Warwickshire, and took him for the dramatist.
He died in 1564 and had a son Henry, amongst whose papers were found
verses belonging to certain entertainments, mostly of the early
‘nineties,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[313]</span> which an indiscreet editor thereupon ascribed to George

<p>This must, I suppose, have been one of the five plays given at Court

185, notes that <span class="allsmcap">I.</span> ii refers to the Cleve wars, which began in
1609. The Revels children were not at Court in 1610–11. In his verses
to <i>The Faithful Shepherdess</i> (1609–10) Field hopes for his ‘muse
in swathing clouts’, to ‘perfect such a work as’ Fletcher’s. The first
Epistle promises that when his next play is printed, any woman ‘shall
see what amends I have made to her and all the sex’; the second ends,
‘If thou hast anything to say to me, thou know’st where to hear of me
for a year or two, and no more, I assure thee’, as if Field did not
mean to spend his life as a player.</p>

at least planned, and probably written, by the end of 1611. Collier,
iii. 434, and Fleay, i. 201, confirm this from an allusion to the play
in A. Stafford’s <i>Admonition to a Discontented Romanist</i>, appended
to his <i>Niobe Dissolved into a Nilus</i> (S. R. 10 Oct. 1611). Fleay
is less happy in fixing an inferior limit of date by the publication
of the version of the <i>Curious Impertinent</i> story in Shelton’s
<i>Don Quixote</i> (1612), since that story was certainly available in
Baudouin’s French translation as early as 1608.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[314]</span> The introduction of

<p class="p-left p2">JOHN FLETCHER (1579–1625).</p>

<p>Fletcher was born in Dec. 1579 at Rye, Sussex, the living of his father
Richard Fletcher, who became Bishop of Bristol, Worcester, and in 1594
London. His cousins, Giles and Phineas, are known as poets. He seems
too young for the John Fletcher of London who entered Corpus Christi,
Cambridge, in 1591. After his father’s death in 1596, nothing is heard
of him until his emergence as a dramatist, and of this the date cannot
be precisely fixed. Davenant says that ‘full twenty yeares, he wore
the bayes’, which would give 1605, but this is in a prologue to <i>The
Woman Hater</i>, which Davenant apparently thought Fletcher’s, although
it is Beaumont’s; and Oliphant’s attempt to find his hand, on metrical
grounds, in <i>Captain Thomas Stukeley</i> (1605) rests only on one
not very conclusive scene. But he had almost certainly written for the
Queen’s Revels before the beginning, about 1608, of his collaboration
with Beaumont, under whom his later career is outlined. It is possible
that he is the John Fletcher who married Joan Herring on 3 Nov. 1612
at St. Saviour’s, Southwark, and had a son John about Feb. 1620 in St.
Bartholomew’s the Great (Dyce, i. lxxiii), and if so one may put the
fact with Aubrey’s gossip (cf. s.v. Beaumont), and with Oldwit’s speech
in Shadwell’s <i>Bury-Fair</i> (1689): ‘I knew Fletcher, my friend
Fletcher, and his maid Joan; well, I shall never forget him: I have
supped with him at his house on the Bankside; he loved a fat loin of
pork of all things in the world; and Joan his maid had her beer-glass
of sack; and we all kissed her, i’ faith, and were as merry as passed.’
I have sometimes wondered whether Jonson is chaffing Beaumont and
Fletcher in <i>Bartholomew Fair</i> (1614), <span class="allsmcap">V.</span> iii, iv, as
Damon and Pythias, ‘two faithfull friends o’ the Bankside’, that ‘have
both but one drabbe’, and enter with a gammon of bacon under their
cloaks. I do not think this can refer to Francis Bacon. Fletcher died
in Aug. 1625 and was buried in St. Saviour’s (<i>Athenaeum</i>, 1886,
ii. 252).</p>

<p class="p-left p2">PHINEAS FLETCHER (1582–1650).</p>

<p>Phineas Fletcher, son of Giles, a diplomatist and poet, brother of
Giles, a poet, and first cousin of John (q.v.), was baptized at
Cranbrook, Kent, on 8 April 1582. From Eton he passed to King’s
College, Cambridge, where he took his B.A. in 1604, his M.A. in 1608,
and became a Fellow in 1611. He was Chaplain to Sir Henry Willoughby of
Risley from 1616 to 1621, and thereafter Rector of Hilgay, Norfolk, to
his death in 1650. He wrote much Spenserian poetry, but his dramatic
work was purely academic. In addition to <i>Sicelides</i>, he may have
written an English comedy, for which a payment was made to him by
King’s about Easter 1607 (Boas, i. xx).</p>

The play was intended for performance before James at Cambridge, but

<p class="p-left p2">FRANCIS FLOWER (<i>c.</i> 1588).</p>

<p>A Gray’s Inn lawyer, one of the devisers of dumb-shows and directors

for which he also wrote two choruses.</p>


<p class="p-left p2">JOHN FORD (1586–1639 &lt;).</p>

<p>Ford’s dramatic career, including whatever share he may have had with
Dekker (q.v.) in <i>Sun’s Darling</i> and <i>Witch of Edmonton</i>,
falls substantially outside my period. But amongst plays entered as his
by Humphrey Moseley on 29 June 1660 (Eyre, ii. 271) are:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘An ill begining has A good end, and a bad begining may have a
good end, a Comedy.’</p>

<p class="p0">‘The London Merchant, a Comedy.’</p>
</div>

<p class="p-left">These ascriptions recur in Warburton’s list of lost plays
(<i>3 Library</i>, ii. 231), where the first play has the title ‘A
good beginning may have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[316]</span> A good end’. It is possible, therefore, that
Ford either wrote or revised the play of ‘A badd beginininge makes a
good endinge’, which was performed by the King’s men at Court during
1612–13 (cf. App. B). One may suspect the <i>London Merchant</i> to be
a mistake for the <i>Bristow Merchant</i> of Ford and Dekker (q.v.) in
1624. The offer of the title in <i>K. B. P.</i> ind. 11 hardly proves
that there was really a play of <i>The London Merchant</i>. Ford’s
<i>Honor Triumphant: or The Peeres Challenge, by Armes defensible at
Tilt, Turney, and Barriers</i> (1606; ed. <i>Sh. Soc.</i> 1843) is a
thesis motived by the jousts in honour of Christian of Denmark (cf. ch.
iv). It has an Epistle to the Countesses of Pembroke and Montgomery,
and contains four arguments in defence of amorous propositions
addressed respectively to the Duke of Lennox and the Earls of Arundel,
Pembroke, and Montgomery.</p>


<p class="p-left p2">EDWARD FORSETT (<i>c.</i> 1553–<i>c.</i> 1630).</p>

<p>A political writer (<i>D. N. B.</i>) and probable author of the
academic <i>Pedantius</i> (cf. App. K).</p>


<p class="p-left p2">ABRAHAM FRAUNCE (<i>c.</i> 1558–1633 &lt;).</p>

<p>Fraunce was a native of Shrewsbury, and passed from the school of
that place, where he obtained the friendship of Philip Sidney, to St.
John’s, Cambridge, in 1576. He took his B.A. in 1580, played in Legge’s
academic <i>Richardus Tertius</i> and in <i>Hymenaeus</i> (Boas, 394),
which he may conceivably have written (cf. App. K), became Fellow of
the college in 1581, and took his M.A. in 1583. He became a Gray’s Inn
man, dedicated various treatises on logic and experiments in English
hexameters to members of the Sidney and Herbert families during
1583–92, and appears to have obtained through their influence some
office under the Presidency of Wales. He dropped almost entirely out of
letters, but seems to have been still alive in 1633.</p>

<p><i>Edition</i> by G. C. Moore Smith (1906, <i>Materialien</i>, xiv).</p>

<p>The play is an adaptation of <i>Il Fedele</i> (1575) by Luigi
Pasqualigo, which is also the foundation of the anonymous <i>Two
Italian Gentlemen</i> (q.v.). As Sidney was knighted on 13 Jan. 1583,
the play was probably written, perhaps for performance at St. John’s,
Cambridge, before that date and after Fraunce took his B.A. in 1580.</p>

Fraunce’s version of <i>Aminta</i> was ever acted.</p>

<p class="p-left p2">ULPIAN FULWELL (<i>c.</i> 1568).</p>

<p>Fulwell was born in Somersetshire and educated at St. Mary’s

<p>This might be <i>The Collier</i> played at Court in 1576. Fleay, 60;
i. 235, puts it in 1561–3, assigns it to the Paul’s boys, and suggests
that Richard Edwardes (q.v.) is satirized as Ralph Roister. Greg
(<i>Henslowe</i>, ii. 228) suggests that Fulwell’s may be the play
revived by Pembroke’s at the Rose on 28 Oct. 1600 as ‘the [devell]
licke vnto licke’.</p>


<p class="p-left p2">WILLIAM GAGER (&gt; 1560–1621).</p>

<p>Gager entered Christ Church, Oxford, from Westminster in 1574, and took
his B.A. in 1577, his M.A. in 1580, and his D.C.L. in 1589. In 1606
he became Chancellor of the diocese of Ely. He had a high reputation
for his Latin verses, many of which are contained in <i>Exequiae D.
Philippi Sidnaei</i> (1587) and other University volumes. A large
collection in <i>Addl. MS.</i> 22583 includes lines to George Peele<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[318]</span>
(q.v.). Meres in 1598 counts him as one of ‘the best for comedy amongst
vs’. His correspondence with John Rainolds affords a summary of the
controversy on the ethics of the stage in its academic aspect.</p>

Pembroke, Leicester, and Sidney were present on the second occasion.

speaks of it as ‘the vnprinted Comedie’, and criticizes its ‘filth’.
It contained scenes of country wooing, drunken sailors, a <i>miles

<p class="p-left p2">GEORGE GASCOIGNE (<i>c.</i> 1535–77).</p>

<p>George Gascoigne was son of Sir John Gascoigne of Cardington,
Bedfordshire. He was probably born between 1530 and 1535, and was
educated at Trinity College, Cambridge, and Gray’s Inn. He misspent
his youth as a dissipated hanger-on at Court, under the patronage of
Arthur, Lord Grey of Wilton and others, and won some reputation as
a versifier. About 1566 he married Elizabeth Breton of Walthamstow,
widow of a London merchant, and mother of Nicholas Breton, the poet.
From March 1573 to Oct. 1574 he served as a volunteer under William of
Orange in the Netherlands. In 1575 he was assisting in preparing shows
before Elizabeth at Kenilworth and Woodstock. It is possible that he
was again in the Netherlands and present at the sack of Antwerp in
1576. On 7 Oct. 1577 he died at Stamford.</p>

<p>Gosson was born in Kent during 1554, was at Corpus Christi, Oxford,
1572 to 1576, then came to London, where he obtained some reputation
as playwright and poet. Meres in <i>Palladis Tamia</i> (1598)
commends his pastorals, which are lost. Lodge speaks of him also as
a ‘player’.<a id="FNanchor_658" href="#Footnote_658" class="fnanchor">[658]</a> In 1579 he forsook the stage, became a tutor in the
country and published <i>The School of Abuse</i> (App. C, No. xxii).
This he dedicated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[323]</span> to Sidney, but ‘was for his labour scorned’. He was
answered the same year in a lost pamphlet called <i>Strange News out
of Afric</i> and also by Lodge (q.v.), and rejoined with <i>A Short
Apology of the School of Abuse</i> (App. C, No. xxiv). The players
revived his plays to spite him and on 23 Feb. 1582 produced <i>The
Play of Plays and Pastimes</i> to confute him. In the same year he
produced his final contribution to the controversy in <i>Plays Confuted
in Five Actions</i> (App. C, No. xxx). In 1591 Gosson became Rector of
Great Wigborough, Essex, and in 1595 published the anonymous pamphlet
<i>Pleasant Quips for Upstart Newfangled Gentlewomen</i>. In 1600 he
became Rector of St. Botolph’s, Bishopsgate. In 1616 and 1617 he wrote
to Alleyn (q.v.) as his ‘very loving and ancient friend’.<a id="FNanchor_659" href="#Footnote_659" class="fnanchor">[659]</a> He died
13 Feb. 1624.</p>

<p>Gosson claims to have written both tragedies and comedies,<a id="FNanchor_660" href="#Footnote_660" class="fnanchor">[660]</a> but
no play of his is extant. He names three of them. Of <i>Catiline’s
Conspiracies</i> he says that it was ‘usually brought into the
Theater and that ‘because it is known to be a pig of mine own sow, I
will speak the less of it; only giving you to understand, that the
whole mark which I shot at in that work was to show the reward of
traitors in Catiline, and the necessary government of learned men in
the person of Cicero, which foresees every danger that is likely to
happen and forestalls it continually ere it take effect’.<a id="FNanchor_661" href="#Footnote_661" class="fnanchor">[661]</a> Lodge
disparages the originality of this play and compares it unfavourably
with Wilson’s <i>Short and Sweet</i><a id="FNanchor_662" href="#Footnote_662" class="fnanchor">[662]</a> (q.v.). Of two other plays
Gosson says: ‘Since my publishing the <i>School of Abuse</i> two plays
of my making were brought to the stage; the one was a cast of Italian
devices, called, The Comedy of <i>Captain Mario</i>; the other a
Moral, <i>Praise at Parting</i>. These they very impudently affirm to
be written by me since I had set out my invective against them. I can
not deny they were both mine, but they were both penned two years at
the least before I forsook them, as by their own friends I am able to
prove.’<a id="FNanchor_663" href="#Footnote_663" class="fnanchor">[663]</a> It is conceivable that Gosson may be the translator of
<i>Fedele and Fortunio</i> (cf. ch. xxiv).</p>


<p class="p-left p2">ROBERT GREENE (1558–92).</p>

<p>Robert Greene was baptized at Norwich on 11 July 1558. He entered St.
John’s College, Cambridge, as a sizar in 1575 and took his B.A. in 1578
and his M.A. by 1583, when he was residing in Clare Hall. The addition
of an Oxford degree in July 1588 enabled him to describe himself as
<i>Academiae Utriusque Magister in Artibus</i>. He has been identified
with a Robert Greene who was Vicar of Tollesbury, Essex, in 1584–5,
but there is no real evidence that he took orders. The earlier part of
his career may be gathered from his autobiographic pamphlet, <i>The
Repentance of Robert Greene</i> (1592), eked out by the portraits, also
evidently in a measure autobiographic, of Francesco in <i>Never Too
Late</i> (1590) and of Roberto in <i>Green’s Groats-worth of Wit bought
with a Million of Repentance</i> (1592). It seems that he travelled in
youth and learnt much wickedness; then married and lived for a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[324]</span> while
with his wife and had a child by her. During this period he began his
series of euphuistic love-romances. About 1586, however, he deserted
his wife, and lived a dissolute life in London with the sister of
Cutting Ball, a thief who ended his days at Tyburn, as his mistress.
By her he had a base-born son, Fortunatus. He does not seem to have
been long in London before he ‘had wholly betaken me to the penning
of plays which was my continual exercise’.<a id="FNanchor_664" href="#Footnote_664" class="fnanchor">[664]</a> His adoption of his
profession seems to be described in <i>The Groats-worth of Wit</i>.
Roberto meets a player, goes with him, and soon becomes ‘famozed for
an arch-plaimaking poet’.<a id="FNanchor_665" href="#Footnote_665" class="fnanchor">[665]</a> Similarly, in <i>Never Too Late</i>,
Francesco ‘fell in amongst a company of players, who persuaded him to
try his wit in writing of comedies, tragedies, or pastorals, and if he
could perform anything worthy of the stage, then they would largely
reward him for his pains’. Hereupon Francesco ‘writ a comedy, which so
generally pleased the audience that happy were those actors in short
time, that could get any of his works, he grew so exquisite in that
faculty’.<a id="FNanchor_666" href="#Footnote_666" class="fnanchor">[666]</a> Greene’s early dramatic efforts seem to have brought him
into rivalry with Marlowe (q.v.). In the preface to <i>Perimedes the
Blacksmith</i> (S. R. 29 March 1588) he writes: ‘I keep my old course
to palter up something in prose, using mine old poesie still, Omne
tulit punctum, although lately two Gentlemen Poets made two mad men of
Rome beat it out of their paper bucklers: and had it in derision for
that I could not make my verses jet upon the stage in tragical buskins,
every word filling the mouth like the faburden of Bo-Bell, daring God
out of heaven with that Atheist <i>Tamburlan</i>, or blaspheming with
the mad priest of the Sun.... Such mad and scoffing poets that have
poetical spirits, as bred of Merlin’s race, if there be any in England
that set the end of scholarism in an English blank-verse, I think
either it is the humour of a novice that tickles them with self-love,
or too much frequenting the hot-house (to use the German proverb) hath
sweat out all the greatest part of their wits.... I but answer in print
what they have offered on the stage.’<a id="FNanchor_667" href="#Footnote_667" class="fnanchor">[667]</a> The references here to
Marlowe are unmistakable. His fellow ‘gentleman poet’ is unknown; but
the ‘mad priest of the Sun’ suggests the play of ‘the lyfe and deathe
of Heliogabilus’, entered on S. R. to John Danter on 19 June 1594, but
now lost.<a id="FNanchor_668" href="#Footnote_668" class="fnanchor">[668]</a> In 1589 Greene published his <i>Menaphon</i> (S. R.
23 Aug.), in which he further alluded to Marlowe as the teller of ‘a
Canterbury tale; some prophetical full-mouth that as he were a Cobler’s
eldest son, would by the last tell where anothers shoe wrings’.<a id="FNanchor_669" href="#Footnote_669" class="fnanchor">[669]</a>
Doron, in the same story, appears to parody a passage in the anonymous
play of <i>The Taming of A Shrew</i>, which is further alluded to in a
prefatory epistle <i>To the Gentlemen Students of Both Universities</i>
contributed to Greene’s book by Thomas Nashe. Herein Nashe, while
praising Peele and his <i>Arraignment of Paris</i>, satirizes
Marlowe, Kyd, and particularly the players (cf. App. C, No. xlii). To
<i>Menaphon</i> are also<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[325]</span> prefixed lines by Thomas Brabine which tells
the ‘wits’ that ‘strive to thunder from a stage-man’s throat’ how the
novel is beyond them. ‘Players, avaunt!’<a id="FNanchor_670" href="#Footnote_670" class="fnanchor">[670]</a> In the following year,
1590, Greene continued the attack on the players in the autobiographic
romance, already referred to, of <i>Never Too Late</i> (cf. App. C,
No. xliii). In 1590 Greene, whose publications had hitherto been
mainly toys of love and romance, began a series of moral pamphlets,
full of professions of repentance and denunciations of villainy. To
these belong, as well as <i>Never Too Late</i>, <i>Greene’s Mourning
Garment</i> (1590) and <i>Greene’s Farewell to Folly</i> (1591).
A preface to the latter contains some satirical references to the
anonymous play of <i>Fair Em</i> (cf. ch. xxiv.) One R. W. retorted
upon Greene in a pamphlet called <i>Martine Mar-Sextus</i> (S. R. 8
Nov. 1591), in which he abuses lascivious authors who finally ‘put on a
mourning garment and cry Farewell’.<a id="FNanchor_671" href="#Footnote_671" class="fnanchor">[671]</a> Similarly, Greene’s exposures
of ‘cony-catching’ or ‘sharping’ provoked the following passage in the
<i>Defence of Cony-catching</i> (S. R. 21 April 1592) by one Cuthbert
Conycatcher: ‘What if I should prove you a cony-catcher, Master R. G.,
would it not make you blush at the matter?... Ask the Queen’s players
if you sold them not Orlando Furioso for twenty nobles, and when they
were in the country sold the same play to the Lord Admiral’s men for
as many more.... I hear, when this was objected, that you made this
excuse; that there was no more faith to be held with players than with
them that valued faith at the price of a feather; for as they were
comedians to act, so the actions of their lives were camelion-like;
that they were uncertain, variable, time-pleasers, men that measured
honesty by profit, and that regarded their authors not by desert but
by necessity of time.’<a id="FNanchor_672" href="#Footnote_672" class="fnanchor">[672]</a> It is probable that the change in the tone
of Greene’s writings did not correspond to any very thorough-going
reformation of life. There is nothing to show that Greene had any
share in the Martinist controversy. But he became involved in one of
the personal animosities to which it led. Richard Harvey, the brother
of Gabriel, in his <i>Lamb of God</i> (S. R. 23 Oct. 1589), while
attacking Lyly as Paphatchet, had ‘mistermed all our other poets and
writers about London, piperly make-plaies and make-bates. Hence Greene,
beeing chiefe agent for the companie [i.e. the London poets] (for
hee writ more than foure other, how well I will not say: but <i>sat
citò, si sat benè</i>) tooke occasion to canuaze him a little.’<a id="FNanchor_673" href="#Footnote_673" class="fnanchor">[673]</a>
Apparently he called the Harveys, in his <i>A Quip for an Upstart
Courtier</i> (S. R. 21 July 1592, cf. App. C, No. xlvii), the sons of
a ropemaker, which is what they were.<a id="FNanchor_674" href="#Footnote_674" class="fnanchor">[674]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[326]</span> In August Greene partook
freely of Rhenish wine and pickled herrings at a supper with Nashe and
one Will Monox, and fell into a surfeit. On 3 September he died in a
squalid lodging, after writing a touching letter to his deserted wife,
and begging his landlady, Mrs. Isam, to lay a wreath of bays upon him.
These details are recorded by Gabriel Harvey, who visited the place
and wrote an account of his enemy’s end in a letter to a friend, which
he published in his <i>Four Letters and Certain Sonnets: especially
Touching Robert Greene, and Other Parties by him Abused</i> (S. R. 4
Dec. 1592).<a id="FNanchor_675" href="#Footnote_675" class="fnanchor">[675]</a> This brought Nashe upon him in the <i>Strange News of
the Intercepting of Certain Letters</i><a id="FNanchor_676" href="#Footnote_676" class="fnanchor">[676]</a> (S. R. 12 Jan. 1593) and
began a controversy between the two which lasted for several years. In
<i>Pierce’s Supererogation</i> (27 Apr. 1593) Harvey spoke of ‘Nash,
the ape of Greene, Greene the ape of Euphues, Euphues the ape of Envy’,
and declared that Nashe ‘shamefully and odiously misuseth every friend
or acquaintance as he hath served ... Greene, Marlowe, Chettle, and
whom not?’<a id="FNanchor_677" href="#Footnote_677" class="fnanchor">[677]</a> In <i>Have With You to Saffron Walden</i> (1596), Nashe
defends himself against these accusations. ‘I never abusd Marloe,
Greene, Chettle in my life.... He girds me with imitating of Greene....
I scorne it ... hee subscribing to me in anything but plotting Plaies,
wherein he was his crafts master.’<a id="FNanchor_678" href="#Footnote_678" class="fnanchor">[678]</a> The alleged abuse of Marlowe,
Greene, and Chettle belongs to the history of another pamphlet. This is
<i>Green’s Groats-worth of Wit, Bought with a Million of Repentance</i>
(S. R. 20 Sept. 1592, ‘upon the peril of Henry Chettle’<a id="FNanchor_679" href="#Footnote_679" class="fnanchor">[679]</a>).
According to the title-page, it was ‘written before his death and
published at his dying request’. To this is appended the famous address
<i>To those Gentlemen, his Quondam Acquaintance, that spend their
wits in making Plays</i>.<a id="FNanchor_680" href="#Footnote_680" class="fnanchor">[680]</a> The reference here to Shakespeare is
undeniable. Of the three playwrights warned, the first and third are
almost certainly Marlowe and Peele; the third may be Lodge, but on
the whole is far more likely to be Nashe (q.v.). It appears, however,
that Nashe himself was supposed to have had a hand in the authorship.
Chettle did his best to take the responsibility off Nashe’s shoulders
in the preface to his <i>Kind-Hart’s Dream</i> (S. R. 8 Dec. 1592; cf.
App. C, No. xlix). In the epistle prefixed to the second edition of
<i>Pierce Penniless his Supplication to the Devil</i> (<i>Works</i>, i.
154), written early in 1593, Nashe denies the charge for himself and
calls <i>The Groats-worth</i> ‘a scald trivial lying pamphlet’; and
it is perhaps to this that Harvey refers as abuse of Greene, Marlowe,
and Chettle, although it is not clear how Marlowe comes in. There is
an echo of Greene’s hit at the ‘upstart crow, beautified with our
feathers’ in the lines of R. B., <i>Greene’s Funerals</i> (1594, ed.
McKerrow, 1911, p. 81):</p>

<p>There is general agreement that, on grounds of style, this should
be the earliest of Greene’s extant plays. In <span class="allsmcap">IV.</span> 1444 is
an allusion to ‘mighty Tamberlaine’, and the play reads throughout
like an attempt to emulate the success of Marlowe’s play of 1587 (?).
In <span class="allsmcap">IV.</span> i Mahomet speaks out of a brazen head. The play may
therefore be alluded to in the ‘Mahomet’s poo [pow]’ of Peele’s (q.v.)
<i>Farewell</i> of April 1589, although Peele may have intended his
own lost play of <i>The Turkish Mahomet and Hiren the Fair Greek</i>.
There is no reference in <i>Alphonsus</i> to the Armada of 1588. On
the whole, the winter of 1587 appears the most likely date for it, and
if so, it is possibly the play whose ill success is recorded by Greene
in the preface to <i>Perimedes</i> (1588). The Admiral’s revived a
<i>Mahomet</i> on 16 Aug. 1594, inventoried ‘owld Mahemetes head’ in
1598, and revived the play again in Aug. 1601, buying the book from
Alleyn, who might have brought it from Strange’s, or bought it from
the Queen’s (Greg, <i>Henslowe</i>, ii. 167; <i>Henslowe Papers</i>,
116). Collins dates <i>Alphonsus</i> in 1591, on a theory, inconsistent
with the biographical indications of the pamphlets, that Greene’s
play-writing did not begin much before that year. A ‘Tragicomoedia von
einem Königk in Arragona’ played at Dresden in 1626 might be either
this play or <i>Mucedorus</i> (Herz, 66, 78).</p>

<p>The facts of Lodge’s (q.v.) life leave 1588, before the Canaries
voyage, or 1589–91, between that voyage and Cavendish’s expedition,
as possible dates for the play. In favour of the former is Lodge’s
expressed intention in 1589 to give up ‘penny-knave’s delight’. On
the other hand, the subject is closely related to that of Greene’s
moral pamphlets, the series of which begins in 1590, and the fall of
Nineveh is referred to in <i>The Mourning Garment</i> of that year.
Fleay, ii. 54, and Collins, i. 137, accept 1590 as the date of the
play. Gayley, 405, puts it in 1587, largely on the impossible notion
that its ‘priest of the sun’ (<span class="allsmcap">IV.</span> iii. 1540) is that referred
to in the <i>Perimedes</i> preface, but partly also from the absence
of any reference to the Armada. It is possible that ‘pleasing Alcon’
in Spenser’s <i>Colin Clout’s Come Home Again</i> (1591) may refer to
Lodge as the author of the character Alcon in this play. <i>The Looking
Glass</i> was revived by Strange’s men on 8 March 1592. The clown is
sometimes called Adam in the course of the dialogue (ll. 1235 sqq.,
1589 sqq., 2120 sqq.), and a comparison with <i>James IV</i> suggests
that the original performer was John Adams of the Queen’s men, from
whom Henslowe may have acquired the play. Fleay, ii. 54, and Gayley,
405, make attempts to distinguish Greene’s share from Lodge’s, but
do not support their results by arguments. Crawford, <i>England’s
Parnassus</i>, xxxii, 441, does not regard Allot’s ascription of the
passages he borrowed to Greene and Lodge respectively as trustworthy.

<p>Fleay, in <i>Appendix B</i> to Ward’s ed., argues from <span class="allsmcap">I.</span> i.
137, ‘next Friday is S. James’, that the date of the play is 1589, in
which year St. James’s Day fell on a Friday. This does not seem to me
a very reliable argument. Probably the play followed not long after
Marlowe’s <i>Doctor Faustus</i> (q.v.), itself probably written in
1588–9. The date of 1589, which Ward, i. 396, and Gayley, 411, accept,
is likely enough. Collins prefers 1591–2, and notes (ii. 4) a general
resemblance in tone and theme to <i>Fair Em</i>, but there is nothing
to indicate the priority of either play, and no charge of plagiarism
in the pamphlets (<i>vide supra</i>) to which <i>Fair Em</i> gave
rise. <i>Friar Bacon</i> was revived by Strange’s men on 19 Feb. 1592,
and again by the Queen’s and Sussex’s men together on 1 April 1594.
Doubtless it was Henslowe’s property, as Middleton wrote a prologue and
epilogue for a performance by the Admiral’s men at Court at Christmas
1602 (Greg, <i>Henslowe</i>, ii. 149).</p>

ll. 595–1592 of the Q<sub>q</sub>, but contains passages not in those texts. It

<p>The Armada (1588) is referred to in <span class="allsmcap">I.</span> i. 87. Two passages are
common to the play and Peele’s <i>Old Wive’s Tale</i> (before 1595),
and were probably borrowed by Peele with the name Sacripant, which
Greene got from Ariosto. The play cannot be the ‘King Charlemagne’ of
Peele’s (q.v.) <i>Farewell</i> (April 1589), as Charlemagne does not
appear in it. The appearance of Sir John Harington’s translation of
Ariosto’s <i>Orlando Furioso</i> in 1591 suggests that as a likely
date. This also would fit the story (<i>vide supra</i>) of the second
sale to the Admiral’s men, when the Queen’s ‘were in the country’ (cf.
vol. ii, p. 112). Strange’s men played <i>Orlando</i> for Henslowe on
22 Feb. 1592. Collins, i. 217, seems to accept 1591 as the date, but
Fleay, i. 263, Ward, i. 395, and Gayley, 409,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[330]</span> prefer 1588–9. So does
Greg (<i>Henslowe</i>, ii. 150) on the assumption that <i>Old Wive’s
Tale</i> (q.v.) ‘must belong to 1590’. A ‘Comoedia von Orlando Furioso’
was acted at Dresden in 1626 (Herz, 66, 77).</p>

<p>There is very little to date the play. Its comparative merit perhaps
justifies placing it, as Greene’s maturest drama, in 1591. Collins, i.
44, agrees; but Fleay, i. 265; Ward, i. 400; Gayley, 415, prefer 1590.
Fleay finds traces of a second hand, whom he believes to be Lodge, but
he is not convincing. In l. 2269 the name Adam appears for Oberon in
a stage-direction, which, when compared with <i>A Looking-Glass</i>,
suggests that the actor was John Adams of the Queen’s.</p>



<p class="center p1"><i>Lost Play</i></p>

<p>Warburton’s list of burnt plays (<i>3 Library</i>, ii. 231) contains
the duplicate entries ‘His<sup>t</sup> of Jobe by Rob. Green’ and ‘The Trag<sup>d</sup> of
Jobe. Good.’ Greg suggests a confusion with Sir Robert Le Grys, who
appears in the list as ‘S<sup>r</sup> Rob. le Green’.</p>

<p>The statement that Greene had a share in a play on Henry VIII
(<i>Variorum</i>, xix. 500) seems to be based on a confusion with a
Robert Greene named by Stowe as an authority for his <i>Annales</i>
(Collins, i. 69).</p>

<p class="p-left p2">FULKE GREVILLE, LORD BROOKE (<i>c.</i> 1554–1628).</p>

<p>Greville’s father, Sir Fulke, was a cadet of the Grevilles of Milcote,
and held great estates in Warwickshire. The son was born at Beauchamp
Court ten years before he entered Shrewsbury School on 17 Oct. 1564
with Philip Sidney, of whom he wrote, <i>c.</i> 1610–12, a <i>Life</i>
(ed. Nowell Smith, 1907). In 1568 he went to Jesus College, Cambridge,
and from 1577 was a courtier in high favour with Elizabeth, and
entrusted with minor diplomatic and administrative tasks. He took
part in the great tilt of 15 May 1581 (cf. ch. xxiv) and was a steady
patron of learning and letters. His own plays were for the closet. He
was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[331]</span> knighted in 1597. James granted him Warwick Castle in 1605, but
he was no friend of Robert Cecil, and took no great part in affairs
until 1614, when he became Chancellor of the Exchequer. In 1621 he was
created Lord Brooke. On 1 Sept. 1628 he was stabbed to death by his
servant Ralph Haywood. D. Lloyd, <i>Statesmen of England</i> (1665),
504, makes him claim to have been ‘master’ to Shakespeare and Jonson.</p>

<p class="p-left p2">RICHARD HATHWAY (<i>c.</i> 1600).</p>

<p>Practically nothing is known of Hathway outside Henslowe’s diary,
although he was included by Meres amongst the ‘best for comedy’ in
1598, and wrote commendatory verses for Bodenham’s <i>Belvedere</i>
(1600). It is only conjecture that relates him to the Hathaways of
Shottery in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[333]</span> Warwickshire, of whom was Shakespeare’s father-in-law,
also a Richard. He has left nothing beyond an undetermined share
of <i>1 Sir John Oldcastle</i>, but the following plays by him are
traceable in the diary:</p>



<p class="center p1">(a) <i>Plays for the Admiral’s, 1598–1602</i></p>

<p class="p0">With Munday, July 1598. It is uncertain what relation, if any, this
bore to an anonymous play of the same name which was twice entered in
the S. R. on 23 May 1595 and 31 March 1600 (Arber, ii. 298, iii. 159),
was ascribed in both entries to the Queen’s and not the Admiral’s, and
is not known to be extant.</p>

1637, may have been a revision of this.</p>

<p class="p0">With Day and one or more other ‘felowe poetes’, March 1603.</p>


<p class="p-left p2">CHRISTOPHER HATTON (1540–91).</p>

<p>Christopher Hatton, of Holdenby, Northants, entered the Inner Temple
in Nov. 1559. He was Master of the Game at the Grand Christmas of
1561, and the mask to which he is said to have owed his introduction
to Elizabeth’s favour was probably that which the revellers took to
Court, together with Norton (q.v.) and Sackville’s <i>Gorboduc</i> on
18 Jan. 1562. He became a Gentleman Pensioner in 1564, Gentleman of
the Privy Chamber, Captain of the Guard in 1572, Vice-Chamberlain and
Privy Councillor in 1578, when he was knighted, and Lord Chancellor
on 25 April 1587. He was conspicuous at Court in masks and tilts, and
is reported, even as Lord Chancellor, to have laid aside his gown and
danced at the wedding of his nephew and heir, Sir William Newport,
alias Hatton, to Elizabeth Gawdy at Holdenby in June 1590.</p>

<p>His only contribution to the drama is as writer of an act of <i>Gismond
of Salerne</i> at the Inner Temple in 1568 (cf. s.v. Wilmot).</p>


<p class="p-left p2">WILLIAM HAUGHTON (<i>c.</i> 1575–1605).</p>

<p>Beyond his extant work and the entries in Henslowe’s diary, in the
earliest of which, on 5 Nov. 1597, he appears as ‘yonge’ Haughton,
little is known of Haughton. Cooper, <i>Ath. Cantab.</i> ii. 399,
identified him with an alleged Oxford M.A. of the same name who was
incorporated at Cambridge in 1604, but turns out to have misread the
name, which is ‘Langton’ (Baugh, 15). He worked for the Admiral’s
during 1597–1602, and found himself in the Clink in March 1600. Baugh,
22, prints his will, made on 6 June 1605, and proved on 20 July.
He left a widow Alice and children. Wentworth Smith (q.v.) and one
Elizabeth Lewes were witnesses. He was then of Allhallows, Stainings.
He cannot be traced in the parish, but the name, which in his will is
Houghton, is also spelt by Henslowe Harton, Horton, Hauton, Hawton,
Howghton, Haughtoun, Haulton, and Harvghton, and was common in London.
He might be related to a William Houghton, saddler, who held a house in
Turnmill Street in 1577 (Baugh, 11), since in 1601 (<i>H. P.</i> 57)
Day requested that a sum due to Haughton and himself might be paid to
‘Will Hamton sadler’.</p>

<p>The evidence for Haughton’s evidence is in two payments in Henslowe’s
diary of 18 Feb. and early in May 1598 on behalf of the Admiral’s. The
sum of these is only £2, but it seems possible that at least one, and
perhaps more than one, other payment was made for the book in 1597 (cf.

<p>Translator of Seneca (q.v.).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[338]</span></p>


<p class="p-left p2">THOMAS HEYWOOD (<i>c.</i> 1570–1641).</p>

<p>Heywood regarded Lincolnshire as his ‘country’ and had an uncle
Edmund, who had a friend Sir Henry Appleton. K. L. Bates has found
Edmund Heywood’s will of 7 Oct. 1624 in which Thomas Heywood and
his wife are mentioned, and has shown it to be not improbable that
Edmund was the son of Richard Heywood, a London barrister who had
manors in Lincolnshire. If so, Thomas was probably the son of Edmund’s
disinherited elder brother Christopher who was aged 30 in 1570. And if
Richard Heywood is the same who appears in the circle of Sir Thomas
More, a family connexion with the dramatist John Heywood may be
conjectured. The date of Thomas’s birth is unknown, but he tells us
that he was at Cambridge, although a tradition that he became Fellow
of Peterhouse cannot be confirmed, and is therefore not likely to have
begun his stage career before the age of 18 or thereabouts. Perhaps we
may conjecture that he was born <i>c.</i> 1570, for a Thomas Heywood
is traceable in the St. Saviour’s, Southwark, token-books from 1588
to 1607, and children of Thomas Heywood ‘player’ were baptized in the
same parish from 28 June 1590 to 5 Sept. 1605 (Collier, in <i>Bodl.
MS.</i> 29445). This is consistent with his knowledge (App. C, No.
lvii) of Tarlton, but not of earlier actors. He may, therefore, so far
as dates are concerned, easily have written <i>The Four Prentices</i>
as early as 1592; but that he in fact did so, as well as his possible
contributions to the Admiral’s repertory of 1594–7, are matters of
inference (cf. Greg, <i>Henslowe</i>, ii. 284). The editors of the
<i>Apology for Actors</i> (Introd. v) say that in his <i>Funeral
Elegy upon James I</i> (1625) he claims to have been ‘the theatrical
servant of the Earl of Southampton, the patron of Shakespeare’. I have
never seen the Elegy. It is not in the B. M., but a copy passed from
the Bindley to the Brown collection. There is no other evidence that
Southampton ever had a company of players. The first dated notice of
Heywood is in a payment of Oct. 1596 on behalf of the Admiral’s ‘for
Hawodes bocke’. On 25 March 1598 he bound himself to Henslowe for two
years as an actor, doubtless for the Admiral’s, then in process of
reconstitution. Between Dec. 1598 and Feb. 1599 he wrote two plays
for this company, and then disappears from their records. He was not
yet out of his time with Henslowe, but if <i>Edward IV</i> is really
his, he may have been enabled to transfer his services to Derby’s men,
who seem to have established themselves in London in the course of
1599. By the autumn of 1602 he was a member of Worcester’s, for whom
he had probably already written <i>How a Man may Choose a Good Wife
from a Bad</i>. He now reappears in Henslowe’s diary both as actor and
as playwright. On 1 Sept, he borrowed 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> to buy
garters, and between 4 Sept, and 6 March 1603 he wrote or collaborated
in not less than seven plays for the company. During the same winter
he also helped in one play for the Admiral’s. It seems probable that
some of his earlier work was transferred to Worcester’s. He remained
with them, and in succession to them Queen Anne’s, until the company
broke up soon after the death of the Queen in 1619. Very little of
his work got into print. Of the twelve plays at most which appeared
before 1619, the first seven<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[339]</span> were unauthorized issues; from 1608
onwards, he himself published five with prefatory epistles. About this
date, perhaps in the enforced leisure of plague-time, he also began
to produce non-dramatic works, both in prose and verse, of which the
<i>Apology for Actors</i>, published in 1612, but written some years
earlier (cf. App. C, No. lvii), is the most important. The loss of his
<i>Lives of All the Poets</i>, apparently begun <i>c.</i> 1614 and
never finished, is irreparable. After 1619 Heywood is not traceable
at all as an actor; nor for a good many years, with the exception
of one play, <i>The Captives</i>, for the Lady Elizabeth’s in 1624,
as a playwright, either on the stage or in print. In 1623 a Thomas
Heywarde lived near Clerkenwell Hill (<i>Sh.-Jahrbuch</i>, xlvi. 345)
and is probably the dramatist. In 1624 he claims in the Epistle to
<i>Gynaikeion</i> the renewed patronage of the Earl of Worcester, since
‘I was your creature, and amongst other your servants, you bestowed me
upon the excellent princesse Q. Anne ... but by her lamented death,
your gift is returned againe into your hands’. But about 1630 he
emerges again. Old plays of his were revived and new ones produced both
by Queen Henrietta’s men at the Cockpit and the King’s at the Globe
and Blackfriars. He wrote the Lord Mayor’s pageants for a series of
years. He sent ten more plays to the press, and included a number of
prologues, epilogues, and complimentary speeches of recent composition
in his <i>Pleasant Dialogues and Dramas</i> of 1637. This period lies
outside my survey. I have dealt with all plays in which there is a
reasonable prospect of finding early work, but have not thought it
necessary to discuss <i>The English Traveller</i>, or <i>A Maidenhead
Well Lost</i>, merely because of tenuous attempts by Fleay to connect
them with lost plays written for Worcester’s or still earlier anonymous
work for the Admiral’s, any more than <i>The Fair Maid of the West</i>,
<i>The Late Lancashire Witches</i>, or <i>A Challenge for Beauty</i>,
with regard to which no such suggestion is made. As to <i>Love’s
Mistress</i>, see the note on <i>Pleasant Dialogues and Dramas</i>.
The Epistle to <i>The English Traveller</i> (1633) is worth quoting.
Heywood describes the play as ‘one reserued amongst two hundred and
twenty, in which I haue had either an entire hand, or at the least a
maine finger’, and goes on to explain why his pieces have not appeared
as <i>Works</i>. ‘One reason is, that many of them by shifting and
change of Companies, haue beene negligently lost, Others of them are
still retained in the hands of some Actors, who thinke it against their
peculiar profit to haue them come in Print, and a third, That it neuer
was any great ambition in me, to bee in this kind Volumniously read.’
Heywood’s statement would give him an average of over five plays a
year throughout a forty years’ career, and even if we assume that he
included every piece which he revised or supplied with a prologue, it
is obvious that the score or so plays that we have and the dozen or so
others of which we know the names must fall very short of his total
output. ‘Tho. Heywood, Poet’, was buried at St. James’s, Clerkenwell,
on 16 Aug. 1641 (<i>Harl. Soc. Reg.</i> xvii. 248), and therefore
the alleged mention of him as still alive in <i>The Satire against
Separatists</i> (1648) must rest on a misunderstanding.</p>

<p><i>Editions</i> in Dodsley<sup>2, 3</sup> (1780–1827) and by W. Scott (1810,
<i>A. B. D.</i> iii).</p>

<p>The Prologue gives the title as <i>True and Strange, or The Four
Prentises of London</i>. The Epistle speaks of the play as written
‘many yeares since, in my infancy of iudgment in this kinde of poetry,
and my first practice’ and ‘some fifteene or sixteene yeares agoe’.
This would, by itself, suggest a date shortly after the publication
of Fairfax’s translation from Tasso under the title of <i>Godfrey of
Bulloigne, or The Recouerie of Ierusalem</i> in 1600. But the Epistle
also refers to a recent revival of ‘the commendable practice of long
forgotten armes’ in ‘the Artillery Garden’. This, according to Stowe,
<i>Annales</i> (1615), 906, was in 1610, which leads Fleay, i. 182,
followed by Greg (<i>Henslowe</i>, ii. 166), to assume that the Epistle
was written for an edition, now lost, of about that date. In support
they cite Beaumont’s <i>K. B. P.</i> iv. 1 (dating it 1610 instead of
1607), ‘Read the play of the <i>Foure Prentices of London</i>, where
they tosse their pikes so’. Then, calculating back sixteen years,
they arrive at the anonymous <i>Godfrey of Bulloigne</i> produced by
the Admiral’s on 19 July 1594, and identify this with <i>The Four
Prentices</i>, in which Godfrey is a character. But this <i>Godfrey of
Bulloigne</i> was a second part, and it is difficult to suppose that
the first part was anything but the play entered on the S. R. earlier
in 1594. This, from its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">[341]</span> title, clearly left no room for a second part
covering the same ground as <i>The Four Prentices</i>, which ends
with the capture of Jerusalem. If then Heywood’s play is as old as
1594 at all, it must be identified with the first part of <i>Godfrey
of Bulloigne</i>. And is not this in its turn likely to be the
<i>Jerusalem</i> played by Strange’s men on 22 March and 25 April 1592?
If so, Heywood’s career began very early, and, as we can hardly put his
Epistle earlier than the opening of the Artillery Garden in 1610, his
‘fifteene or sixteene yeares’ must be rather an understatement. There
is of course nothing in the Epistle itself to suggest that the play had
been previously printed, but we know from the Epistle to <i>Lucrece</i>
that the earliest published plays by Heywood were surreptitious.</p>

<p>Greg, <i>Henslowe</i>, ii. 230, hesitatingly suggests that a purchase
by Worcester’s of ‘iiij lances for the comody of Thomas Hewedes &amp; M<sup>r</sup>.
Smythes’ on 3 Sept. 1602 may have been for a revival of <i>The Four
Prentices</i>, ‘where they tosse their pikes so’, transferred from the
Admiral’s. But I think his afterthought, that the comedy was Heywood
and Smith’s <i>Albere Galles</i>, paid for on the next day, is sound.</p>

<p>The Epilogue describes the play as ‘old’, and apparently relates it to
a time when rhyme, of which it makes considerable use, was more looked
after than ‘strong lines’, and when stuffed and puffed doublets and
trunk-hose were worn, which would fit the beginning of the seventeenth
century. An anonymous Marshal is a leading character, and the
identification by Fleay, i. 300, with the <i>Marshal Osric</i> written
by Heywood and Smith for Worcester’s in Sept. 1602 is not the worst of
his guesses.</p>

by Ward, ii. 574, and others. It may be added that there are obvious

of Queene Elizabeth as it was last revived at the Cockpit, in which
the Author taxeth the most corrupted copy now imprinted, which was
published without his consent’. It says:</p>

<p class="p-left">There is also an Epilogue, which shows that both parts
were revived. The piracy may serve to date the original production in
1605 and the Caroline revival probably led to the reprints of 1632. As
the play passed to the Cockpit, it was presumably written for Queen
Anne’s. Greg (<i>Henslowe</i>, ii. 223) rightly resists the suggestion
that it was the old <i>Philip of Spain</i> bought by the Admiral’s
from Alleyn in 1602. It is only Part i which has characteristics
attributable to stenography, and this remained unrevised. According to
Van Dam and Stoffel, the 1606 and 1632 editions of Part ii represent
the same original text, in the first case shortened for representation,
in the second altered by a press-corrector.</p>

<p>The action is placed in the reign of Elizabeth (cf. ed. Pearson, vi,

is a pamphlet (S. R. 15 Aug. 1586) dealing with Elizabethan piracy.
Rowley’s co-operation suggests the date 1607–9 when he was writing for
Queen Anne’s men, and other trifling evidence (Aronstein, 237) makes
such a date plausible.</p>

<p>Fleay, i. 292, notes the mention of ‘the King’s head’ as a tavern sign
for ‘the Gentry’, which suggests a Jacobean date. The play was given at
Court, apparently by the King’s and Queen’s men together, on 13 Jan.
1612. The Epistle says that it has not been Heywood’s custom ‘to commit
my Playes to the Presse’, like others who ‘have used a double sale of
their labours, first to the Stage, and after to the Presse’. He now
does so because ‘some of my Playes have (unknowne to me, and without
any of my direction) accidentally come into the Printers hands (and
therefore so corrupt and mangled, copied only by the eare) that I have
beene as unable to knowe them, as ashamed to challenge them’. A play
on the subject seems to have been on tour in Germany in 1619 (Herz,
98). <i>The Rape of Lucrece</i> was on the Cockpit stage in 1628,
according to a newsletter in <i>Athenaeum</i> (1879), ii. 497, and to
the 1638 edition are appended songs ‘added by the stranger that lately
acted Valerius his part’. It is in the Cockpit list of plays in 1639

<p>The Epistle describes the play as ‘the eldest brother of three Ages,

iudged to the presse’, and promises the others. It came to the press
‘accidentally’, but Heywood, ‘at length hauing notice thereof’,
prefaced it, as it had ‘already past the approbation of auditors’.
Fleay, i. 283, followed hesitatingly by Greg (<i>Henslowe</i>,
ii. 175), thinks it a revision of the <i>Olympo</i> or <i>Seleo &amp;
Olempo</i>, which he interprets <i>Coelo et Olympo</i>, produced by
the Admiral’s on 5 March 1595. The Admiral’s inventories show that
they had a play with Neptune in it, but it is only at the very end of
<i>The Golden Age</i> that the sons of Saturn draw lots and Jupiter
wins Heaven or Olympus. Fleay’s assumption that the play was revised
<i>c.</i> 1610, because of Dekker, <i>If it be not Good</i>, i. 1, ‘The
Golden Age is moulding new again’, is equally hazardous.</p>

the anonymous <i>Hercules</i>, produced by the Admiral’s men on 7

represents the play as given at Court, apparently by the King’s and
Queen’s men together, on 12 Jan. 1612. An Anglo-German <i>Amphitryo</i>

<p>The Epistles tell us that ‘these were the playes often (and not
with the least applause,) Publickely Acted by two Companies, vppon
one Stage at once, and haue at sundry times thronged three seuerall
Theaters, with numerous and mighty Auditories’; also that they ‘haue
beene long since Writ’. This, however, was in 1632, and I can only
read the Epistles to the earlier <i>Ages</i> as indicating that the
<i>Iron Age</i> was contemplated, but not yet in existence, up to
1613. I should therefore put the play <i>c.</i> 1613, and take the
three theatres at which it was given to be the Curtain, Red Bull,
and Cockpit. Fleay, i. 285, thinks that Part i was the anonymous
<i>Troy</i> produced by the Admiral’s on 22 June 1596. More plausible
is the conjecture of Greg (<i>Henslowe</i>, ii. 180) that this was ‘an
earlier and shorter version later expanded into the two-part play’.

<p><i>Edition</i> by W. Bang (1903, <i>Materialien</i>, iii).</p>

<p>The section called ‘Sundry Fancies writ upon severall occasions’
(Bang, 231) includes a number of Prologues and Epilogues, of which
those which are datable fall between 1630 and 1636. Bang regards all
the contents of the volume as of about this period. Fleay, i. 285, had
suggested that <i>Deorum Judicium</i>, <i>Jupiter and Io</i>, <i>Apollo
and Daphne</i>, <i>Amphrisa</i>, and possibly <i>Misanthropos</i>
formed the anonymous <i>Five Plays in One</i> produced by the
Admiral’s on 7 April 1597, and also that <i>Misanthropos</i>, which
he supposed to bear the name <i>Time’s Triumph</i>, was played with
<i>Faustus</i> on 13 April 1597 and carelessly entered by Henslowe
as ‘times triumpe &amp; fortus’. Greg (<i>Henslowe</i>, ii. 183) says
of the <i>Dialogues and Dramas</i>, ‘many of the pieces in that
collection are undoubtedly early’. He rejects Fleay’s views as to
<i>Misanthropos</i> on the grounds that it is ‘unrelieved tediousness’
and has no claim to the title <i>Time’s Triumph</i>, and is doubtful
as to <i>Deorum Judicium</i>. The three others he seems inclined
to accept as possibly belonging to the 1597 series, especially
<i>Jupiter and Io</i>, where the unappropriated head of Argus in one
of the Admiral’s inventories tempts him. He is also attracted by an
alternative suggestion of Fleay’s that one of the <i>Five Plays in
One</i> may have been a <i>Cupid and Psyche</i>, afterwards worked up
into <i>Love’s Mistress</i> (1636). This he says, ‘if it existed’,
would suit very well. Unfortunately, there is no evidence that it
did exist. Moreover, P. A. Daniel has shown that certain lines found
in <i>Love’s Mistress</i> are assigned to Dekker in <i>England’s
Parnassus</i> (1600, ed. Crawford, xxxi. 509, 529) and must be from
the <i>Cupid and Psyche</i> produced by the Admiral’s <i>c.</i> June
1600 (<i>Henslowe</i>, ii. 212). There is no indication that Heywood
collaborated with Dekker, Chettle, and Day in this; but it occurs to me
that, if he was still at the Rose, he may have acted in the play and
cribbed years afterwards from the manuscript of his part. I will only
add that <i>Misanthropos</i> and <i>Deorum Judicium</i> seem to me out
of the question. They belong to the series of ‘dialogues’ which Heywood
in his Epistle clearly treats as distinct from the ‘dramas’, for after
describing them he goes on, ‘For such as delight in Stage-poetry, here
are also divers Dramma’s, never<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">[347]</span> before published: Which, though some
may condemne for their shortnesse, others againe will commend for
their sweetnesse’. It is only <i>Jupiter and Io</i> and <i>Apollo and
Daphne</i>, which are based on Ovid, and <i>Amphrisa</i>, for which
there is no known source, that can belong to this group; and Heywood
gives no indication as to their date.</p>

<p class="p-left p2">WILLIAM HUNNIS (?-1597).</p>

<p>[Nearly all that is known of Hunnis, except as regards his connexion
with the Blackfriars, and much that is conjectural has been gathered
and fully illustrated by Mrs. C. C. Stopes in <i>Athenaeum</i> and
<i>Shakespeare-Jahrbuch</i> papers, and finally in <i>William Hunnis
and the Revels of the Chapel Royal</i> (1910, <i>Materialien</i>,
xxix).]</p>

<p>The date of Hunnis’s birth is unknown, except as far as it can be
inferred from the reference to him as ‘in winter of thine age’ in 1578.
He is described on the title-page of his translation of <i>Certayne
Psalmes</i> (1550) as ‘seruant’ to Sir William Herbert, who became
Earl of Pembroke. He is in the lists of the Gentlemen of the Chapel
about 1553, but he took part in plots against Mary and in 1556 was
sent to the Tower. He lost his post, but this was restored between
Elizabeth’s accession in 1558 and the opening of the extant <i>Cheque
Book</i> of the Chapel in 1561, and on 15 Nov. 1566 he was appointed
Master of the Children in succession to Richard Edwardes (q.v.). For
the history of his Mastership, cf. ch. xii (Chapel). Early in 1559 he
married Margaret, widow of Nicholas Brigham, Teller of the Exchequer,
through whom he acquired a life-interest in the secularized Almonry at
Westminster. She died in June 1559, and about 1560 Hunnis married Agnes
Blancke, widow of a Grocer. He took out the freedom of the Grocers’
Company, and had a shop in Southwark. He was elected to the livery of
the Company in 1567, but disappears from its records before 1586. In
1569 he obtained a grant of arms, and is described as of Middlesex.
From 1576–85, however, he seems to have had a house at Great Ilford,
Barking, Essex. His only known child, Robin, was page to Walter Earl
of Essex in Ireland, and is said in <i>Leicester’s Commonwealth</i>
to have tasted the poison with which Leicester killed Essex in 1576
and to have lost his hair. But he became a Rider of the Stable under
Leicester as Master of the Horse during 1579–83, and received payments
for posting services in later years up to 1593. In 1562 William Hunnis
became Keeper of the Orchard and Gardens at Greenwich, and held this
post with his Mastership to his death. He supplied greenery and flowers
for the Banqueting Houses of 1569 and 1571 (cf. ch. i). In 1570 the
Queen recommended him to the City as Taker of Tolls and Dues on London
Bridge, and his claim was bought off for £40. In 1583 he called
attention to the poor remuneration of the Mastership, and in 1585 he
received grants of land at Great Ilford and elsewhere. He died on 6
June 1597.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">[350]</span></p>

<p>Hunnis published several volumes of moral and religious verse, original
and translated: <i>Certayne Psalmes</i> (1550); <i>A Godly new Dialogue
of Christ and a Sinner</i> (S. R. 1564, if this is rightly identified
with the <i>Dialogue</i> of Hunnis’s 1583 volume); <i>A Hive Full of
Honey</i> (1578, S. R. 1 Dec. 1577, dedicated to Leicester); <i>A
Handful of Honnisuckles</i> (<span class="allsmcap">N.D.</span>, S. R. 11 Dec. 1578, a New
Year’s gift to the Ladies of the Privy Chamber); <i>Seven Sobbes of
a Sorrowful Soule for Sinne</i> (1583, S. R. 7 Nov. 1581, with the
<i>Handful of Honnisuckles</i>, <i>The Widow’s Mite</i>, and <i>A
Comfortable Dialogue between Christ and a Sinner</i>, dedicated to
Lady Sussex); <i>Hunnies Recreations</i> (1588, S. R. 4 Dec. 1587,
dedicated to Sir Thomas Heneage). Several poems by Hunnis are also
with those of Richard Edwardes and others in <i>The Paradyse of Daynty
Deuises</i> (1567); one, the <i>Nosegay</i>, in Clement Robinson’s
<i>A Handfull of Pleasant Delites</i> (1584); and it is usual to
assign to him two bearing the initials W. H., <i>Wodenfride’s Song in
Praise of Amargana</i> and <i>Another of the Same</i>, in <i>England’s
Helicon</i> (1600).</p>

<p>The name of no play by Hunnis has been preserved, although he may
probably enough have written some of those produced by the Chapel boys
during his Mastership. That he was a dramatist is testified to by the
following lines contributed by Thomas Newton, one of the translators of
Seneca, to his <i>Hive Full of Honey</i>.</p>

<p class="p-left">Newton’s account of his friend’s poetic evolution seems to assign
his ‘enterludes’ to an early period of mainly secular verse; but if
this preceded his <i>Certayne Psalmes</i> of 1550, which are surely
of ‘graver matters’, it must have gone back to Henry VIII’s reign,
far away from his Mastership. On the other hand, Hunnis was certainly
contributing secular verse and devices to the Kenilworth festivities
(cf. s.v. Gascoigne) only three years before Newton wrote. Mrs.
Stopes suggests, with some plausibility, that the Amargana songs of
<i>England’s Helicon</i> may come from an interlude. She also assigns
to Hunnis, by conjecture, <i>Godly Queen Hester</i>, in which stress is
laid on Hester’s Chapel Royal, and <i>Jacob and Esau</i> (1568, S. R.
1557–8), which suggests gardens.</p>

in A. F. Westcott, <i>New Poems of James I</i> (1911). The bridal pair
were George Gordon, 6th Earl and afterwards 1st Marquis of Huntly,
and Henrietta Stuart, daughter of Esme, Duke of Lennox. The verses
consist of a hymeneal dialogue, with a preliminary invocation by the
writer, and speeches by Mercury, Nimphes, Agrestis, Skolar, Woman, The
Vertuouse Man, Zani, The Landvart Gentleman, The Soldat. The earlier

<p>[<i>MS.</i>] <i>Lansdowne MS.</i> 807, f. 57. [The MS. contains the
relics of John Warburton’s collection, and on a slip once attached to
the fly-leaf is his famous list of burnt plays, which includes ‘Bugbear
C. Jo<sup>n</sup>. Geffrey’ (Greg in <i>3 Library</i>, ii. 232). It appears to be
the work of at least five hands, of which one, acting as a corrector,
as well as a scribe, may be that of the author. The initials J. B.
against a line or two inserted at the end do not appear to be his, but,
as there was no single scribe, he may be writer of a final note to
the text, written in printing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">[352]</span> characters, ‘Soli deo honor et gloria
Johannus Jeffere scribebat hoc’. This note is followed by the songs and
their music, and at the top of the first is written ‘Giles peperel for
Iphiginia’. On the last page are the names ‘Thomas Ba ...’ and ‘Frances
Whitton’, which probably do not indicate authorship. A title-page may
be missing, and a later hand has written at the head of the text, ‘The
Buggbears’.]</p>

<p><i>Editions</i> by C. Grabau (1896–7, <i>Archiv</i>, xcviii. 301; xcix.

Dibelius (<i>Archiv</i>, cxii. 204).</p>

<p>The play is an adaptation of A. F. Grazzini, <i>La Spiritata</i>
(1561), and uses also material from J. Weier (<i>De Praestigiis
Daemonum</i>) (1563) and from the life of Michel de Nôtredame
(Nostradamus), not necessarily later than his death in 1566. Bond is
inclined to date the play, partly on metrical grounds, about 1564
or 1565. Grabau and Dibelius suggest a date after 1585, apparently
under the impression that the name Giles in the superscription to the
music may indicate the composition of Nathaniel Giles, of the Chapel
Royal, who took his Mus. Bac. in 1585. But the name, whether of a
composer, or of the actor of the part of Iphigenia, is Giles Peperel.
The performers were ‘boyes’, but the temptation to identify the play
with the <i>Effiginia</i> shown by Paul’s at Court on 28 Dec. 1571 is
repressed by the description of <i>Effiginia</i> in the Revels account
as a ‘tragedye’, whereas <i>The Bugbears</i> is a comedy. Moreover,
Iphigenia is not a leading part, although one added by the English
adapter.</p>


<p class="p-left p2">LAURENCE JOHNSON (<i>c.</i> 1577).</p>

<p>A possible author of <i>Misogonus</i> (cf. ch. xxiv).</p>


<p class="p-left p2">BENJAMIN JONSON (1572–1637).</p>

<p>Benjamin Johnson, or Jonson, as he took the fancy to spell his name,
was born, probably on 11 June 1572, at Westminster, after the death
of his father, a minister, of Scottish origin. He was withheld, or
withdrawn, from the University education justified by his scholastic
attainments at Westminster to follow his step-father’s occupation of
bricklaying, and when this proved intolerable, he served as a soldier
in the Netherlands. In a prologue to <i>The Sad Shepherd</i>, left
unfinished at his death in August 1637, he describes himself as ‘He
that has feasted you these forty years’, and by 1597 at latest his
connexion with the stage had begun. Aubrey tells us (ii. 12, 226) that
he ‘acted and wrote, but both ill, at the Green Curtaine, a kind of
nursery or obscure play-house, somewhere in the suburbes (I thinke
towards Shoreditch or Clarkenwell)’, and again that he ‘was never a
good actor, but an excellent instructor’. The earliest contemporary
records, however, show Jonson not at the Curtain, but on the Bankside.
On 28 July 1597 Henslowe (i. 200) recorded a personal loan to ‘Bengemen
Johnson player’ of £4 ‘to be payd yt agayne when so euer ether I or
any for me shall demande yt’, and on the very same day he opened on
another page of his diary (i. 47) an account headed ‘Received of
Bengemenes Johnsones share as ffoloweth 1597’ and entered in it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">[353]</span> the
receipt of a single sum of 3<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i>, to which no addition
was ever made. Did these entries stand alone, one would infer, on the
analogy of other transactions of Henslowe’s and from the signatures of
two Admiral’s men as witnesses to the loan, that Jonson had purchased
a share in the Admiral’s company for £4, that he borrowed the means
to do this from Henslowe, and that Henslowe was to recoup himself by
periodical deductions from the takings of the company as they passed
through his hands. But there is no other evidence that Jonson ever
had an interest in the Admiral’s, and there are facts which, if one
could believe that Henslowe would regard the takings of any company
but the Admiral’s as security for a loan, would lead to the conclusion
that Jonson’s ‘share’ was with Pembroke’s men at the Swan. The day of
Henslowe’s entries, 28 July 1597, is the very day on which the theatres
were suppressed as a result of the performance of <i>The Isle of
Dogs</i> (cf. App. D, No. cx), and it is hardly possible to doubt that
Jonson was one of the actors who had a hand with Nashe (q.v.) in that
play. The Privy Council registers record his release, with Shaw and
Spencer of Pembroke’s men, from the Marshalsea on 3 Oct. 1597 (Dasent,
xxviii. 33; cf. App. D, No. cxii); while Dekker in <i>Satiromastix</i>
(l. 1513) makes Horace admit that he had played Zulziman in Paris
Garden, and Tucca upbraid him because ‘when the Stagerites banisht
thee into the Ile of Dogs, thou turn’dst Bandog (villanous Guy) &amp; ever
since bitest’. The same passage confirms Aubrey’s indication that
Jonson was actor, and a bad actor, as well as poet. ‘Thou putst vp a
supplication’, says Tucca, ‘to be a poor iorneyman player, and hadst
beene still so, but that thou couldst not set a good face vpon ’t:
thou hast forgot how thou amblest (in leather pilch) by a play-wagon,
in the high way, and took’st mad Ieronimoes part, to get seruice among
the mimickes.’ Elsewhere (l. 633) Tucca taunts him that ‘when thou
ranst mad for the death of Horatio, thou borrowedst a gowne of Roscius
the stager, (that honest Nicodemus) and sentst it home lowsie’. This
imprisonment for the <i>Isle of Dogs</i> is no doubt the ‘bondage’
for his ‘first error’ to which Jonson refers in writing to Salisbury
about <i>Eastward Ho!</i> in 1605, and the ‘close imprisonment, under
Queen Elizabeth’, during which he told Drummond he was beset by spies
(Laing, 19). Released, Jonson borrowed 5<i>s.</i> more from Henslowe
(i. 200) on 5 Jan. 1598, and entered into a relationship with him and
the Admiral’s as a dramatist, which lasted intermittently until 1602.
It was broken, not only by plays for the King’s men, whose employment
of him, which may have been at the Curtain, was due, according to Rowe,
to the critical instinct of Shakespeare (H.-P. ii. 74), and for the
Chapel children when these were established at Blackfriars in 1600,
but also by a quarrel with Gabriel Spencer, whose death at his hands
during a duel with swords in Hoxton Fields on 22 Sept. 1598 was ‘harde
&amp; heavey’ news to Henslowe (<i>Henslowe Papers</i>, 48) and brought
Jonson to trial for murder, from which he only escaped by reading his
neck-verse (Jeaffreson, <i>Middlesex County Records</i>, i. xxxviii;
iv. 350; cf. Laing, 19). Jonson’s pen was critical, and to the years
1600–2 belongs the series of conflicts with other poets and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">[354]</span> with the
actors generically known as the <i>Poetomachia</i> or Stage Quarrel
(cf. ch. xi). Meanwhile Jonson, perhaps encouraged by his success in
introducing a mask into <i>Cynthia’s Revels</i> (1601), seems to have
conceived the ambition of becoming a Court poet. At first he was not
wholly successful, and the selection of Daniel to write the chief
Christmas mask of 1603–4 appears to have provoked an antagonism between
the two poets, which shows itself in Jonson’s qualified acknowledgement
to Lady Rutland of the favours done him by Lady Bedford (<i>Forest</i>,
xii):</p>

  <div class="poetry-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div class="i4">though she have a better verser got,</div>
        <div>(Or poet, in the court-account) than I,</div>
        <div>And who doth me, though I not him envy,</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

<p class="p-left">and long after in the remark to Drummond (Laing, 10)
that ‘Daniel was at jealousies with him’. But the mask was a form of
art singularly suited to Jonson’s genius. In the next year he came to
his own, and of ten masks at Court during 1605–12 not less than eight
are his. This employment secured him a considerable vogue as a writer
of entertainments and complimentary verses, and a standing with James
himself, with the Earl of Salisbury, and with other persons of honour,
which not only brought him pecuniary profit, but also enabled him to
withstand the political attacks made upon <i>Sejanus</i>, for which
he was haled before the Council, and upon <i>Eastward Ho!</i>, for
which he was once more imprisoned. During this period he continued to
write plays, with no undue frequency, both for the King’s men and for
the Queen’s Revels and their successors, the Lady Elizabeth’s. As a
rule, he had published his plays, other than those bought by Henslowe,
soon after they were produced, and in 1612 he seems to have formed the
design of collecting them, with his masks and occasional verses, into a
volume of Works. Probably the design was deferred, owing to his absence
in France as tutor to the son of Sir Walter Raleigh, from the autumn
of 1612 (<i>M. P.</i> xi. 279) to some date in 1613 earlier than 29
June, when he witnessed the burning of the Globe (<i>M. L. R.</i> iv.
83). For the same reason he took no part in the masks for the Princess
Elizabeth’s wedding at Shrovetide. But he returned in time for that
of the Earl of Somerset at Christmas 1613, and wrote three more masks
before his folio <i>Works</i> actually appeared in 1616. In the same
year he received a royal pension of 100 marks.</p>

<p>Jonson’s later life can only be briefly summarized. During a visit to
Scotland he paid a visit to William Drummond of Hawthornden in January
1619, and of his conversation his host took notes which preserve many
biographical details and many critical utterances upon the men, books,
and manners of his time. In 1621 (cf. ch. iii) he obtained a reversion
of the Mastership of the Revels, which he never lived to enjoy. His
masks continued until 1631, when an unfortunate quarrel with Inigo
Jones brought them to an end. His play-writing, dropped after 1616,
was resumed about 1625, and to this period belong his share in <i>The
Bloody Brother</i> of the Beaumont and Fletcher series, <i>The Staple
of News</i>, <i>The New Inn</i>, <i>The Magnetic Lady</i>, and <i>The
Tale of a Tub</i>. In 1637, probably on 6 August, he died. He had told<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">[355]</span>
Drummond ‘that the half of his comedies were not in print’, as well as
that ‘of all his playes he never gained two hundreth pounds’ (Laing,
27, 35), and in 1631 he began the publication, by instalments, of a
second volume of his Works. This was completed after his death, with
the aid of Sir Kenelm Digby, in 1640 and 1641. But it did not include
<i>The Case is Altered</i>, the printing of which in 1609 probably
lacked his authority, or the Henslowe plays, of which his manuscripts,
if he had any, may have perished when his library was burnt in 1623.</p>

<p>As Nashe, <i>Lenten Stuff</i> (<i>Works</i>, iii. 220), which was
entered in S. R. on 11 Jan. 1599, refers to ‘the merry coblers cutte
in that witty play of <i>the Case is altered</i>’, and as <span class="allsmcap">I.</span>
i chaffs Anthony Munday as ‘in print already for the best plotter’,
alluding to the description of him in Francis Meres’s <i>Palladis
Tamia</i> (S. R. 7 Sept. 1598), the date would seem at first sight to
be closely fixed to the last few months of 1598. But <span class="allsmcap">I.</span> i
has almost certainly undergone interpolation. Antonio Balladino, who
appears in this scene alone, and whose dramatic function is confused
with that later (<span class="allsmcap">II.</span> vii) assigned to Valentine, is only
introduced for the sake of a satirical portrait of Munday. He is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">[358]</span>
‘pageant poet to the City of Milan’, at any rate ‘when a worse cannot
be had’. He boasts that ‘I do use as much stale stuff, though I say it
myself, as any man does in that kind’, and again, ‘An they’ll give me
twenty pound a play, I’ll not raise my vein’. Some ‘will have every
day new tricks, and write you nothing but humours’; this pleases the
gentlemen, but he is for ‘the penny’. Crawford points out that there
are four quotations from the play in Bodenham’s <i>Belvedere</i>
(1600), of which Munday was the compiler, and suggests that he would
have left it alone had the ridicule of himself then been a part of it.
I should put the scene later still. Antonio makes an offer of ‘one
of the books’ of his last pageant, and as far as is known, although
Munday may have been arranging city pageants long before, the first
which he printed was that for 1605. Nor does the reference to plays
of ‘tricks’ and ‘humours’ necessarily imply proximity to Jonson’s own
early comedies, for Day’s <i>Law Tricks</i> and his <i>Humour out of
Breath</i>, as well as probably the anonymous <i>Every Woman in her
Humour</i>, belong to 1604–8. Moreover, the play was certainly on
the stage about this time, since the actors are called ‘Children of
Blackfriars’, although of course this would not be inconsistent with
their having first produced it when they bore some other name. The
text is in an odd state. Up to the end of Act <span class="allsmcap">III</span> it has been
arranged in scenes, on the principle usually adopted by Jonson; after
‘Actus 3 [an error for 4] Scaene 1’ there is no further division, and
in Act <span class="allsmcap">V</span> verse and prose are confused. As Jonson was careful
about the printing of his plays, as there is no epistle, and as <i>C.
A.</i> was left out of the Ff., there is some reason to suppose that
the publication in this state was not due to him. Is it possible
that Day, whom Jonson described to Drummond as a ‘rogue’ and a ‘base
fellow’, was concerned in this transaction? It is obvious that, if
<span class="allsmcap">I.</span> i is a later addition, the original production may have
been earlier than 1598. And the original company is unknown. The mere
fact that the Children of the Blackfriars revived it shortly before
1609 does not in the least prove that it was originally written for the
Children of the Chapel. If Chapman’s <i>All Fools</i> is a Blackfriars
revival of an Admiral’s play, <i>C. A.</i> might even more easily be a
Blackfriars revival of a play written, say, for the extinct Pembroke’s.
With the assumption that <i>C. A.</i> was a Chapel play disappears the
assumption that the Chapel themselves began their renewed dramatic
activities at a date earlier than the end of 1600. Selin shows a fair
amount of stylistic correspondence with Jonson’s other work, but it is
quite possible that, as suggested by Herford (<i>R. E. C.</i> ii. 9),
he had a collaborator. If so, Chapman seems plausible.</p>

<p><i>C. A.</i> has nothing to do with the <i>Poetomachia</i>. Hart (<i>9
N. Q.</i> xi. 501, xii. 161, 263) finds in the vocabulary of Juniper
a parody of the affected phraseology of Gabriel Harvey, and in the
critical attitude of Valentine a foreshadowing of such autobiographical
studies as that of Asper in <i>E. M. O.</i> His suggestion that the
cudgel-play between Onion and Martino in II. vii represents the
controversy between Nashe and Martin Marprelate is perhaps less
plausible. Nashe would be very likely to think the chaff of Harvey
‘witty’.</p>

<p>The date assigned by F<sub>1</sub> is confirmed by an allusion (<span class="allsmcap">IV.</span>
iv. 15) to the ‘fencing Burgullian’ or Burgundian, John Barrose, who
challenged all fencers in that year, and was hanged for murder on
10 July (Stowe, <i>Annales</i>, 787). The production must have been
shortly before 20 Sept, when Toby Mathew wrote to Dudley Carleton
(<i>S. P. D. Eliz.</i> cclxviii. 61; Simpson, ix) of an Almain who
lost 300 crowns at ‘a new play called, Euery mans humour’. Two
short passages were taken from the play in R. Allot’s <i>England’s
Parnassus</i> (1600, ed. Crawford, xxxii. 110, 112, 436) which is
earlier than Q<sub>1</sub>. The Q<sub>1</sub> text (<span class="allsmcap">I.</span> i. 184) contains a
hit at Anthony Munday in ‘that he liue in more penurie of wit and
inuention, then eyther the Hall-Beadle, or Poet Nuntius’. This has
disappeared from F<sub>1</sub>, which in other respects represents a complete
revision of the Q<sub>1</sub> text. Many passages have been improved from a
literary point of view; the scene has been transferred from Italy to
London and the names anglicized; the oaths have all been expunged or
softened. Fleay, i. 358, finding references to a ‘queen’ in F<sub>1</sub>
for the ‘duke’ of Q<sub>1</sub> and an apparent dating of St. Mark’s Day on
a Friday, assigned the revision to 1601, and conjectured that it was
done by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">[360]</span> Jonson for the Chapel, that the Chamberlain’s published the Q
in revenge, and that Jonson tried to stay it. Here he is followed by
Castelain. But Q<sub>1</sub> is a good edition and there is no sign whatever
that it had not Jonson’s authority, and as the entry in S. R. covers
other Chamberlain’s plays, it is pretty clear that the company caused
the ‘staying’. St. Mark’s Day did not, as Fleay thought, fall on a
Friday in 1601, and if it had, the dating is unchanged from Q<sub>1</sub> and
the references to a queen may, as Simpson suggests, be due to Jonson’s
conscientious desire to preserve consistency with the original date of
1598. Nor is the play likely to have passed to the Chapel, since the
King’s men played it before James on 2 Feb. 1605 (cf. App. B). This
revival would be the natural time for a revision, and in fact seems to
me on the whole the most likely date, in spite of two trifling bits
of evidence which would fit in rather better a year later. These are
references to the siege of Strigonium or Graan (1595) as ten years
since (<span class="allsmcap">III.</span> i. 103), and to a present by the Turkey company
to the Grand Signior (<span class="allsmcap">I.</span> ii. 78), which was perhaps the
gift worth £5,000 sent about Christmas 1605 (<i>S. P. D. Jac. I</i>,
xv. 3; xvii. 35; xx. 27). No doubt also the revision of oaths in
Jacobean plays is usually taken as due to the <i>Act against Abuses
of Players</i> (1606), although it is conceivable that the personal
taste of James may have required a similar revision of plays selected
for Court performance at an earlier date. Or this particular bit of
revision, which was done for other plays before F<sub>1</sub>, may be of later
date than the rest. Simpson is in favour, largely on literary grounds,
for a revision in 1612, in preparation for F<sub>1</sub>. The Prologue, which
is not in Q, probably belongs to the revision, or at any rate to a
revival later than 1598, since it criticizes not only ‘Yorke, and
Lancasters long jarres’, but also plays in which ‘Chorus wafts you
ore the seas’, as in <i>Henry V</i> (1599). These allusions would not
come so well in 1612; on the other hand, Simpson’s date would enable
us to suppose that the play in which the public ‘grac’d monsters’ was
the <i>Tempest</i> (cf. the similar jibe in <i>Bartholomew Fair</i>).
The character Matheo or Mathew represents a young gull of literary
tendencies, and is made to spout passages from, or imitations of,
Daniel’s verses. Perhaps this implies some indirect criticism of
Daniel, but it can hardly be regarded as a personal attack upon him.</p>

<p>In the main the text of F<sub>1</sub> follows that of Q<sub>1</sub> with some slight
revision of wording and oaths. The arrangement of the epilogues is
somewhat different, but seems intended to represent the same original
stage history. In Q<sub>1</sub> Macilente speaks an epilogue, ‘with Aspers
tongue (though not his shape)’, evidently used in the theatre as it
begs ‘The happier spirits in this faire-fild Globe’ to confirm applause</p>

<p class="p-left">Then comes a ‘Finis’ and on the next page, ‘It had
another <i>Catastrophe</i> or Conclusion at the first Playing: which
(διὰ τὸ τὴν βασίλισσαν προσωποποιεῖσθαι) many seem’d not to relish it:
and therefore ’twas since alter’d: yet that a right-ei’d and solide
<i>Reader</i> may perceiue it was not so great a part of the Heauen
awry, as they would make it; we request him but to looke downe vpon
these following Reasons.’ There follows an apology, from which it is
clear that originally Macilente was cured of his envious humour by the
appearance on the stage of the Queen; and this introduces a different
epilogue of the nature of an address to her. At the end of all comes a
short dialogue between Macilente, as Asper, and the <i>Grex</i>. There
is no mention of the Globe, but as the whole point of the objection
to this epilogue, which it is not suggested that Elizabeth herself
shared, lay<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">[362]</span> in the miming of the Queen, one would take it, did the
Q<sub>1</sub> stand alone, to have been, like its substitute, a theatre and not
a Court epilogue. In F<sub>1</sub>, however, we get successively (<i>a</i>)
a shortened version of the later epilogue, (<i>b</i>) the dialogue
with the <i>Grex</i>, followed by ‘The End’, and (<i>c</i>) a version
of the original epilogue, altered so as to make it less of a direct
address and headed ‘Which, in the presentation before Queen E. was
thus varyed’. It seems to me a little difficult to believe that the
play was given at Court before it had been ‘practised’ in public
performances, and I conclude that, having suppressed the address to a
mimic Elizabeth at the Globe, Jonson revived it in a slightly altered
form when he took the play to Court at Christmas. As to the date of
production, Fleay, i. 361, excels himself in the suggestion that ‘the
mention of “spring” and the allusion to the company’s new “patent”
for the Globe in the epilogue’ fix it to <i>c.</i> April 1599. Even
if this were the original epilogue, it alludes to a coming and not a
present spring, and might have been written at any time in the winter,
either before or after the New Year. Obviously, too, there can be no
allusion to an Elizabethan patent for the Globe, which never existed. I
do not agree with Small, 21, that the Globe was not opened until early
in 1600, nor do I think that any inference can be drawn from the not
very clear notes of dramatic time in <span class="allsmcap">I.</span> iii and <span class="allsmcap">III.</span>
ii. At first sight it seems natural to suppose that the phrase ‘would
I had one of Kempes shooes to throw after you’ (<span class="allsmcap">IV.</span> v) was
written later than at any rate the planning of the famous morris to
Norwich, which lasted from 11 Feb. to 11 March 1600 and at the end of
which Kempe hung his shoes in Norwich Guildhall. Certainly it cannot
refer, as Fleay thinks, merely to Kempe’s leaving the Chamberlain’s
men. Conceivably it might be an interpolation of later date than the
original production. Creizenach, 303, however, points out that in 1599
Thomas Platter saw a comedy in which a servant took off his shoe and
threw it at his master, and suggests that this was a bit of common-form
stage clownery, in which case the Norwich dance would not be concerned.
The performance described by Platter was in September or October, and
apparently at the Curtain (cf. ch. xvi, introd.). Kempe may quite well
have been playing then at the Curtain with a fresh company after the
Chamberlain’s moved to the Globe. Perhaps the episode had already found
a place in Phillips’s <i>Jig of the Slippers</i>, printed in 1595 and
now lost (cf. ch. xviii). If 1600 is the date of <i>E. M. O.</i>, the
Court performance may have been that of 3 February, or perhaps more
probably may have fallen in the following winter, which would explain
the divergence between Q<sub>1</sub> and F<sub>1</sub> as to the epilogues. But it must
be remembered that the F<sub>1</sub> date is 1599, and that most, if not quite
all, of the F<sub>1</sub> dates follow Circumcision style, although Jonson may
not have adopted this style as early as 1600. On the whole, I think
that the balance of probability is distinctly in favour of 1599. If so,
the production must have been fairly late in that year, as there is a
hit (<span class="allsmcap">III.</span> i) at the <i>Histriomastix</i> of the same autumn.
The play has been hunted through and through for personalities, most
of which are effectively refuted by Small. Most of the characters are
types rather<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">[363]</span> than individuals, and social types rather than literary
or stage types. I do not think there are portraits of Daniel, Lyly,
Drayton, Donne, Chapman, Munday, Shakespeare, Burbadge, in the play or
its induction at all. Nor do I think there are portraits in the strict
sense of Marston and Dekker, although no doubt some parody of Marston’s
‘fustian’ vocabulary is put into the mouth of Clove (iii. 1), and, on
the other hand, the characters of Carlo Buffone and Fastidious Brisk
have analogies with the Anaides and Hedon of <i>Cynthia’s Revels</i>,
and these again with the Demetrius and Crispinus of <i>Poetaster</i>,
who are undoubtedly Dekker and Marston. But we know from Aubrey, ii.
184, that Carlo was Charles Chester, a loose-tongued man about town,
to whom there are many contemporary references. To those collected
by Small and Hart (<i>10 N. Q.</i> i. 381) I may add Chamberlain,
7, Harington, <i>Ulysses upon Ajax</i> (1596), 58, and <i>Hatfield
Papers</i>, iv. 210, 221; x. 287. The practical joke of sealing up
Carlo’s mouth with wax (<span class="allsmcap">V.</span> iii) was, according to Aubrey,
played upon Chester by Raleigh, and there may be traits of Raleigh in
Puntarvolo, perhaps combined with others of Sir John Harington, while
Hart finds in the mouths both of Puntarvolo and of Fastidious Brisk the
vocabulary of Gabriel Harvey. The play was revived at Court on 8 Jan.
1605.</p>

<p>The difference between the Q and F<sub>1</sub> texts amounts to more than
mere revision of wording and of oaths. <i>Criticus</i> is renamed
<i>Crites</i>, and the latter half of the play is given in a longer
form, parts of <span class="allsmcap">IV.</span> i and <span class="allsmcap">IV.</span> iii, and the whole of
<span class="allsmcap">V.</span> i-iv appearing in F<sub>1</sub> alone. I think the explanation is
to be found in a shortening of the original text for representation,
rather than in subsequent additions. Jonson’s date for the play is
1600. This Small, 23, would translate as Feb. or March 1601, neglecting
the difficulty due to the possibility that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">[364]</span> Jonson’s date represents
Circumcision style. He relies on <span class="allsmcap">V.</span> xi, where Cynthia says:</p>

  <div class="poetry-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div>For so Actaeon, by presuming farre,</div>
        <div>Did (to our griefe) incurre a fatall doome;</div>
        <div>... But are we therefore judged too extreme?</div>
        <div>Seemes it no crime, to enter sacred bowers,</div>
        <div>And hallowed places, with impure aspect,</div>
        <div>Most lewdly to pollute?</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

<p class="p-left">Rightly rejecting the suggestion of Fleay, i. 363, that
this alludes to Nashe and the <i>Isle of Dogs</i>, Small refers it to
the disgrace of Essex, and therefore dates the play after his execution
on 25 Feb. 1601. But surely the presumption which Jonson has in mind
is not Essex’s rebellion, but his invasion of Elizabeth’s apartment on
his return from Ireland in 1599, and the ‘fatall doome’ is merely his
loss of offices in June 1600. I do not believe that a Court dramatist
would have dared to refer to Essex at all after 25 Feb. 1601. I feel
little doubt that the play was the subject of the Chapel presentation
on 6 Jan. 1601, and the description of this by the Treasurer of the
Chamber as including a ‘show’, which puzzled Small, is explained by the
presence of a full-blown Court mask in <span class="allsmcap">V.</span> vii-x. The original
production will have been in the winter of 1600, soon after Evans set
up the Chapel plays. As to personalities, Small rightly rejects the
identifications of Hedon with Daniel, Anaides with Marston, and Asotus
with Lodge. Amorphus repeats the type of Puntarvolo from <i>E. M.
O.</i> and like Puntarvolo may show traces of the Harveian vocabulary.
As <i>Satiromastix</i>, <span class="allsmcap">I.</span> ii. 191, applies to Crispinus and
Demetrius the descriptions (<span class="allsmcap">III.</span> iii) of Hedon as ‘a light
voluptuous reveller’ and Anaides as ‘a strange arrogating puff’, it
seems clear that Marston and Dekker, rightly or wrongly, fitted on
these caps. Similarly, there is a clear attempt in <i>Satiromastix</i>,
<span class="allsmcap">I.</span> ii. 376, ‘You must be call’d Asper, and Criticus, and
Horace’, to charge Jonson with lauding himself as Criticus. But the
description of the ‘creature of a most perfect and diuine temper’
in <span class="allsmcap">II.</span> iii surely goes beyond even Jonson’s capacity of
self-praise. I wonder whether he can have meant Donne, whom he seems
from a remark to Drummond (Laing, 6) to have introduced as Criticus in
an introductory dialogue to the <i>Ars Poetica</i>.</p>

<p>Of the three children who appear in the induction, both Q and F<sub>1</sub>
name one as Jack. He might be either Underwood or Frost. Q alone
(l. 214) names another, who played Anaides, as Sall, i.e. Salathiel
Pavy. An interesting light is thrown on the beginnings of the Chapel
enterprise by the criticism (<i>Ind.</i> 188), ‘They say, the
<i>Vmbrae</i>, or Ghosts of some three or foure Playes, departed a
dozen yeares since, haue been seene walking on your Stage here.’</p>

<p>The play is admittedly an attack upon the poetaster represented as
Crispinus, and his identity is clear from Jonson’s own statement
to Drummond (Laing, 20) that ‘he had many quarrells with Marston,
beat him, and took his pistol from him, wrote his Poetaster on him’.
Marston’s vocabulary is elaborately ridiculed in <span class="allsmcap">V.</span> iii. Nor
is there any reason to doubt that Demetrius Fannius, ‘a dresser of
plaies about the towne, here’, who has been ‘hir’d to abuse Horace,
and bring him in, in a play’ (<span class="allsmcap">III.</span> iv. 367), is Dekker, who
certainly associated himself with Marston as a victim of Jonson’s
arraignment, and wrote <i>Satiromastix</i> (q.v.) in reply. At the
same time these characters continue the types of Hedon and Anaides
from <i>Cynthia’s Revels</i>, although these were not literary
men. Horace is Jonson himself, as the rival portrait of Horace in
<i>Satiromastix</i> shows, while Dekker tells us that Tucca is ‘honest
Capten Hannam’, doubtless the Jack Hannam traceable as a Captain under
Drake in 1585; cf. the reference to him in a letter of that year
printed by F. P. Wilson in <i>M. L. R.</i> xv. 81. Fleay, i. 367, has
a long list of identifications of minor personages, Ovid with Donne,
Tibullus with Daniel, and so forth, all of which may safely be laid
aside, and in particular I do not think that the fine eulogies of
Virgil (<span class="allsmcap">V.</span> i) are meant for Chapman, or for Shakespeare,
applicable as some of them are to him, or for any one but Virgil. On
the matter of identifications there is little to add to the admirable
treatment of Small, 25. But in addition to the personal attacks,
the play clearly contains a more generalized criticism of actors,
the challenge of which seems to have been specially taken up by the
Chamberlain’s men (cf. ch. xi), while there is evidence that Tucca
and, I suppose, Lupus were taken amiss by the soldiers and the lawyers
respectively. The latter at least were powerful, and in the epistle
to Martin Jonson speaks of the play as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">[366]</span> one ‘for whose innocence,
as for the Authors, you were once a noble and timely undertaker, to
the greatest Iustice of this Kingdome’, and on behalf of posterity
acknowledges a debt for ‘the reading of that ... which so much
ignorance, and malice of the times, then conspir’d to haue supprest’.
Evidently Jonson had not made matters better by his Apologetical
Dialogue, the printing of which with the play was restrained. In this
he denies that he</p>

<p class="p-left">Now he has done with it, will not answer the ‘libells’,
or the ‘untrussers’ (i. e. <i>Satiromastix</i>), and is turning to
tragedy.</p>

<p>Jonson gives the date of production as 1601. The play followed
<i>Cynthia’s Revels</i>, criticisms on the epilogue of which inspired
its ‘armed Prologue’, who sets a foot on Envy. Envy has been waiting
fifteen weeks since the plot was an ‘embrion’, and this is chaffed in
<i>Satiromastix</i>, <span class="allsmcap">I.</span> ii. 447, ‘What, will he bee fifteene
weekes about this cockatrice’s egge too?’ Later (<span class="allsmcap">V.</span> ii. 218)
Horace is told, ‘You and your itchy poetry breake out like Christmas,
but once a yeare’. This stung Jonson, who replied in the Apologetical
Dialogue,</p>

  <div class="poetry-container">

  </div>

<p class="p-left">The year’s interval must not be pressed too closely.
On the other hand, I do not know why Small, 25, assumes that the
fifteen weeks spent on the <i>Poetaster</i> began directly after
<i>Cynthia’s Revels</i> was produced, whatever that date may be. It
must have come very near that of <i>Satiromastix</i>, for Horace knows
that Demetrius has been hired to write a play on him. On the other
hand, <i>Satiromastix</i> cannot possibly have been actually written
until the contents of <i>Poetaster</i> were known to Dekker. The S.
R. entry of <i>Satiromastix</i> is 11 Nov. 1601, and the two dates of
production may reasonably be placed in the late spring or early autumn
of the same year. The Note to the Reader in Q shows that the Dialogue
had been restrained before <i>Poetaster</i> itself appeared in 1602.
Probably it was spoken in December between the two S. R. entries. Hart
(<i>9 N. Q.</i> xi. 202) assuming that the contemplated tragedy was
<i>Sejanus</i> (q.v.) put it in 1603, but this is too late.</p>

<p>As the theatres were probably closed from Elizabeth’s death to March
1604, the production may have been at Court in the autumn or winter
of 1603, although, if <i>Sejanus</i> is the something ‘high, and
aloofe’ contemplated at the end of the Apologetical Dialogue to
<i>Poetaster</i> (q.v.), it must have been in Jonson’s mind since 1601.
The epistle to Aubigny admits the ‘violence’ which the play received in
public, and ‘Ev. B.’s’ verses indicate that this ‘beastly rage’ was at
the Globe. Marston’s verses were presumably written before his renewed
quarrel with Jonson over <i>Eastward Ho!</i> (q.v.), and there appears
to be an unkindly reference to <i>Sejanus</i> in the epistle to his
<i>Sophonisba</i> (1606). But either <i>Eastward Ho!</i> or something
else caused publication to be delayed for nearly a year after the S.
R. entry, since Chapman’s verses contain a compliment to the Earl of
Suffolk,</p>

  <div class="poetry-container">

      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

<p class="p-left">which seems to refer to his share in freeing Jonson
and Chapman from prison about Sept. or Oct. 1605. Chapman also has
compliments to the Earls of Northampton and Northumberland. It must
therefore be to a later date that Jonson referred, when he told
Drummond (Laing, 22) that ‘Northampton was his mortall enimie for
beating, on a St. George’s day, one of his attenders; He was called
before the Councell for his Sejanus, and accused both of poperie and
treason by him’. Fleay, i. 372, suggests that the reference at the end
of the Q version of the Argument to treason against princes, ‘for guard
of whose piety and vertue, the <i>Angels</i> are in continuall watch,
and <i>God</i> himselfe miraculously working’, implies publication
after the discovery of the Plot. On the other hand, one would have
expected Chapman’s reference to Northumberland, if not already printed,
to be suppressed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">[368]</span> in view of the almost immediate suspicion of a
connexion with the Plot that fell upon him. Castelain, 907, considers,
and rightly rejects, another suggestion by Fleay that <i>Sejanus</i>
and not <i>Eastward Ho!</i> was the cause of the imprisonment of Jonson
and Chapman in 1605. Fleay supposed that Chapman was the collaborator
of whom Jonson wrote in the Q epistle, ‘I would informe you, that this
Booke, in all numbers, is not the same with that which was acted on
the publike Stage, wherein a second pen had good share; in place of
which I have rather chosen, to put weaker (and no doubt lesse pleasing)
of mine own, then to defraud so happy a <i>Genius</i> of his right,
by my lothed usurpation’. Shakespeare also has been guessed at. If
Jonson’s language was seriously meant, there were not, of course, many
contemporaries of whom he would have so spoken. Probably the problem is
insoluble, as the subject-matter of it has disappeared. It is difficult
to believe that the collaborator was Samuel Sheppard, who in his <i>The
Times Displayed in Six Sestyads</i> (1646) claims to have ‘dictated
to’ Ben Jonson ‘when as Sejanus’ fall he writ’. Perhaps he means ‘been
amanuensis to’.</p>

<p>Jonson dates the production 1605, and the uncertainty as to the style
he used leaves it possible that this may cover the earlier part of
1606. Fleay, i. 373, attempts to get nearer with the help of the news<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">[369]</span>
from London brought to Venice by Peregrine in <span class="allsmcap">II.</span> i. Some of
this does not help us much. The baboons had probably been in London as
early as 1603 at least (cf. s.v. <i>Sir Giles Goosecap</i>). The Tower
lioness had a whelp on 5 Aug. 1604, another on 26 Feb. 1605, and two
more on 27 July 1605 (Stowe, ed. 1615, 844, 857, 870). The ‘another
whelp’ of <i>Volpone</i> would suggest Feb.–July 1605. On the other
hand, the whale at Woolwich is recorded by Stowe, 880, a few days after
the porpoise at West Ham (not ‘above the bridge’ as in <i>Volpone</i>)
on 19 Jan. 1606. Holt argues from this that, as Peregrine left England
seven weeks before, the play must have been produced in March 1606,
but this identification of actual and dramatic time can hardly be
taken for granted. There are also allusions to meteors at Berwick and
a new star, both in 1604, and to the building of a raven in a royal
ship and the death of Stone the fool, which have not been dated and
might help. Gawdy, 146, writes on 18 June 1604 that ‘Stone was knighted
last weeke, I meane not Stone the foole, but Stone of Cheapsyde’.
Stone the fool was whipped about March, 1605 (Winwood, ii. 52). The
suggested allusion to <i>Volpone</i> in Day’s <i>Isle of Gulls</i>
(q.v.) of Feb. 1606 is rather dubious. The ambiguity of style must
also leave us uncertain whether Q and its dedication belong to 1607 or
1608, and therefore whether ‘their love and acceptance shewn to his
poeme in the presentation’ by the Universities was in 1606 or 1607.
This epistle contains a justification of Jonson’s comic method. He has
had to undergo the ‘imputation of sharpnesse’, but has never provoked
a ‘nation, societie, or generall order, or state’, or any ‘publique
person’. Nor has he been ‘particular’ or ‘personall’, except to ‘a
mimick, cheater, bawd, or buffon, creatures (for their insolencies)
worthy to be tax’d’. But that he has not wholly forgotten the
<i>Poetomachia</i> is clear from a reference to the ‘petulant stiles’
of other poets, while in the prologue he recalls the old criticism that
he was a year about each play, and asserts that he wrote <i>Volpone</i>
in five weeks. The commendatory verses suggest that the play was
successful. Fleay’s theory that it is referred to in the epilogue
to the anonymous <i>Mucedorus</i> (q.v.), as having given offence,
will not bear analysis. The passage in <span class="allsmcap">III.</span> iv about English
borrowings from Guarini and Montaigne is too general in its application
to be construed as a specific attack on Daniel. But the gossip of
Aubrey, ii. 246, on Thomas Sutton, the founder of the Charterhouse,
relates that ‘’Twas from him that B. Johnson took his hint of the fox,
and by Seigneur Volpone is meant Sutton’.</p>

<i>Yale Studies</i>, xxxi) and C. M. Gayley (1913, <i>R. E. C.</i> ii).</p>

<p>The first prologue speaks of the play as fit for ‘your men, and
daughters of <i>white-Friars’</i>, and at Whitefriars the play was
probably produced by the Revels children, either at the end of 1609,
or, if Jonson’s chronology permits, early in 1610. Jonson told Drummond
(Laing, 41) that, ‘When his play of a Silent Woman was first acted,
ther was found verses after on the stage against him, concluding that
that play was well named the Silent Woman, ther was never one man to
say <i>Plaudite</i> to it’. Fleay, i. 374, suggests an equation between
Sir John Daw and Sir John Harington. In <span class="allsmcap">I.</span> i. 86 Clerimont
says of Lady Haughty, the President of the Collegiates, ‘A poxe of
her autumnall face, her peec’d beautie’. I hope that this was not, as
suggested by H. J. C. Grierson, <i>Poems of Donne</i>, ii. 63, a hit at
Lady Danvers, on whom Donne wrote (Elegy ix):</p>

  <div class="poetry-container">

        <div>No <i>Spring</i>, nor <i>Summer</i> Beauty hath such grace,</div>
        <div>As I have seen in one <i>Autumnall</i> face.</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

<p class="p-left">In any case, I do not suppose that these are the passages which led to
the ‘exception’ necessitating the second prologue. This ends with the
lines:</p>

  <div class="poetry-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div>If any, yet, will (with particular slight</div>
        <div class="i1">Of application) wrest what he doth write;</div>
        <div>And that he meant or him, or her, will say:</div>
        <div class="i1">They make a libell, which he made a play.</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

<p class="p-left">Jonson evidently refers to the same matter in the Epistle, where
he says: ‘There is not a line, or syllable in it changed from the
simplicity of the first copy. And, when you shall consider, through the
certaine hatred of some, how much a mans innocency may bee indanger’d
by an vn-certaine accusation; you will, I doubt not, so beginne to
hate the iniquitie of such natures, as I shall loue the contumely done
me, whose end was so honorable, as to be wip’d off by your sentence.’
I think the explanation is to be found in a dispatch of the Venetian
ambassador on 8 Feb. 1610 (<i>V. P.</i> xi. 427), who reports that Lady
Arabella Stuart ‘complains that in a certain comedy the playwright
introduced an allusion to her person and the part played by the
Prince<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">[371]</span> of Moldavia. The play was suppressed.’ The reference may be to
<span class="allsmcap">V.</span> i. 17 of the play:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>La Foole.</i> He [<i>Daw</i>] has his boxe of instruments ...
to draw maps of euery place, and person, where he comes.</p>

<p class="p0"><i>Clerimont.</i> How, maps of persons!</p>

<p class="p0"><i>La Foole.</i> Yes, sir, of Nomentack, when he was here, and
of the Prince of <i>Moldauia</i>, and of his mistris, mistris
<i>Epicoene</i>.</p>

<p class="p0"><i>Clerimont.</i> Away! he has not found out her latitude, I
hope.</p>
</div>

<p class="p-left">The Prince of Moldavia visited London in 1607 and is said to have been
a suitor for Arabella, but if Jonson’s text is really not ‘changed
from the simplicity of the first copy’, it is clear that Arabella
misunderstood it, since Epicoene was Daw’s mistress.</p>

<p>Jonson’s date is confirmed by the references in <span class="allsmcap">II.</span> vi. 31
and <span class="allsmcap">IV.</span> iv. 29 to the age of Dame Pliant, who is 19 and was
born in 1591. In view of the S. R. entry, one would take the production
to have fallen in the earlier half of the year, before the plague
reached forty deaths, which it did from 12 July to 29 Nov. The action
is set in plague-time, but obviously the experience of 1609 and early
years might suggest this. Fleay, i. 375, and others following him
argue that the action of the play is confined to one day, that this
is fixed by <span class="allsmcap">V.</span> v. 102 to ‘the second day of the fourth week
in the eighth month’, and that this must be 24 October. They are not
deterred by the discrepancy of this with <span class="allsmcap">III.</span> ii. 129, which
gives only a fifteen-days interval before ‘the second day, of the third
weeke, in the ninth month’, i. e. on their principles 17 November.
And they get over the S.R. entry by assuming that Jonson planned to
stage the play on 24 October and then, finding early in October that
the plague continued, decided to publish it at once. This seems to me
extraordinarily thin, in the absence of clearer knowledge as to the
system of chronology employed by Ananias of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">[372]</span> Amsterdam. Aubrey, i. 213,
says that John Dee ‘used to distill egge-shells, and ’twas from hence
that Ben Johnson had his hint of the alkimist, whom he meant’. The play
was given by the King’s men at Court during 1612–13.</p>

<p>No dedication to James, other than the prologue and epilogue, appears
to be preserved, but Aubrey, ii. 14, says that ‘King James made
him write against the Puritans, who began to be troublesome in his
time’. The play was given at Court on 1 Nov. 1614 (App. B), and a
mock indenture between the author and the spectators at the Hope,
on 31 Oct. 1614, is recited in the Induction and presumably fixes
the date of production. One must not therefore assume that a ballad
of <i>Rome for Company in Bartholomew Faire</i>, registered on 22
Oct. 1614 (Arber, iii. 554), was aimed at Jonson. Greg, <i>Henslowe
Papers</i>, 78, follows Malone and Fleay, i. 80, in inferring from a
mention of a forthcoming ‘Johnsons play’ in a letter of 13 Nov. 1613
from Daborne to Henslowe that the production may have been intended for
1613, but I think that Daborne refers to the revival of <i>Eastward<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">[373]</span>
Ho!</i> The Induction describes the locality of the Hope as ‘being
as durty as <i>Smithfield</i>, and as stinking euery whit’, and
possibly glances at the <i>Winter’s Tale</i> and <i>Tempest</i> in
disclaiming the introduction of ‘a <i>Seruant-monster</i>’ and ‘a nest
of <i>Antiques</i>’, since the author is ‘loth to make Nature afraid in
his <i>Playes</i>, like those that beget <i>Tales</i>, <i>Tempests</i>,
and such like <i>Drolleries</i>’. There is no actor-list, but in
<span class="allsmcap">V.</span> iii ‘Your best <i>Actor</i>. Your <i>Field</i>?’ is
referred to on a level with ‘your <i>Burbage</i>’. Similarly the puppet
Leander is said to shake his head ‘like an hostler’ and it is declared
that ‘one <i>Taylor</i>, would goe neere to beat all this company,
with a hand bound behinde him’. Field and Taylor were both of the Lady
Elizabeth’s men in 1614, while the allusion to Ostler of the King’s men
is apparently satirical. The suggestion of Ordish, 225, that Taylor is
the water poet, who had recently appeared on the Hope stage, is less
probable. The ‘word out of the play, <i>Palemon</i>’ (<span class="allsmcap">IV.</span> iii)
is set against another, <i>Argalus</i> ‘out of the <i>Arcadia</i>’, and
might therefore, as Fleay, i. 377, thinks, refer to Daniel’s <i>Queen’s
Arcadia</i> (1605), but the Palamon of <i>T. N. K.</i> was probably
quite recent. I see no reason to accept Fleay’s identification of
Littlewit with Daniel; that of Lanthorn Leatherhead with Inigo Jones
is more plausible. Gifford suggested that the burlesque puppet-play
of Damon and Pythias in V. iv may have been retrieved by Jonson from
earlier work, perhaps for the real puppet-stage, since ‘Old Cole’ is a
character, and in <i>Satiromastix</i> Horace is called ‘puppet-teacher’
(1980) and in another passage (607) ‘olde Coale’, and told that
Crispinus and Demetrius ‘shal be thy Damons and thou their Pithyasse’.</p>

<p>In the play itself are introduced references to a performance of <i>The

<p class="center p1"><i>Lost Plays</i></p>

<p>I do not feel able to accept the view, expounded by Fleay, i. 370,
386, and adopted by some later writers, that <i>A Tale of a Tub</i>,
licensed by Herbert on 7 May 1633, was only a revision of one of
Jonson’s Elizabethan plays. It appears to rest almost wholly upon
references to a ‘queen’. These are purely dramatic, and part of an
attempt to give the action an old-fashioned setting. The queen intended
is not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">[374]</span> Elizabeth, but Mary. There are also references to ‘last King
Harry’s time’ (<span class="allsmcap">I.</span> ii), ‘King Edward, our late liege and
sovereign lord’ (<span class="allsmcap">I.</span> v). A character says, ‘He was King Harry’s
doctor and my god-phere’ (<span class="allsmcap">IV.</span> i). The priest is ‘Canon’ or
‘Sir’ Hugh, and has a ‘Latin tongue’ (<span class="allsmcap">III.</span> vii). ‘Old John
Heywood’ is alive (<span class="allsmcap">V.</span> ii).</p>

<p>In 1619 Jonson told Drummond (Laing, 27) ‘That the half of his
Comedies were not in print’. The unprinted ones of course included
<i>Bartholomew Fair</i> and <i>The Devil is an Ass</i>. He went on
to describe ‘a pastorall intitled The May Lord’, in which he figured
himself as Alkin. As it had a ‘first storie’, it may not have been
dramatic. But Alkin appears in <i>The Sad Shepherd</i>, a fragment of
a dramatic pastoral, printed in F<sub>2</sub> with a prologue in which Jonson
describes himself as ‘He that hath feasted you these forty yeares’, and
which therefore cannot have been written long before his death in 1637.
This is edited by W. W. Greg (1905, <i>Materialien</i>, xi) with an
elaborate discussion in which he arrives at the sound conclusions that
the theory of its substantial identity with <i>The May Lord</i> must
be rejected, and that there is no definite evidence to oppose to the
apparent indication of its date in the prologue.</p>

<p>It is doubtful whether any of Jonson’s early work for Pembroke’s and
the Admiral’s, except perhaps <i>The Case is Altered</i>, ever found
its way into print. The record of all the following plays, except the
first, is in Henslowe’s diary (cf. Greg, <i>Henslowe</i>, ii. 288).</p>

<p class="p-left ph">(<i>a</i>) <i>The Isle of Dogs.</i></p>

<p class="p-left">(<i>b</i>) On 3 Dec. 1597 he received £1 ‘vpon a boocke w<sup>ch</sup> he
showed the plotte vnto the company w<sup>ch</sup> he promysed to dd vnto the
company at crysmas’. It is just possible that this was <i>Dido and
Aeneas</i>, produced by the Admiral’s on 8 Jan. 1598. But no further
payment to Jonson is recorded, and it is more likely that <i>Dido and
Aeneas</i> was taken over from Pembroke’s repertory; and it may be that
Jonson had not carried out his contract before the fray with Spencer in
Sept. 1598, and that this is the ‘Bengemens plotte’ on which Chapman
was writing a tragedy on the following 23 Oct. The theory that it is
the <i>Fall of Mortimer</i>, still little more than a plot when Jonson
died, may safely be rejected (Henslowe, ii. 188, 199, 224).</p>

<p>The maskers, in azure and silver, were twelve nymphs, ‘negroes and
the daughters of Niger’; the torchbearers, in sea-green, Oceaniae;
the presenters Oceanus, Niger, and Aethiopia the Moon; the musicians
Tritons, Sea-maids, and Echoes.</p>

<p>The locality was the old Elizabethan banqueting-house at Whitehall
(Carleton; Office of Works). The curtain represented a ‘landtschap’ of
woods with hunting scenes, ‘which falling’, according to the Quarto,
‘an artificial sea was seen to shoot forth’. The MS. describes the
landscape as ‘drawne uppon a downe right cloth, strayned for the scene,
... which openinge in manner of a curtine’, the sea shoots forth. On
the sea were the maskers in a concave shell, and the torchbearers borne
by sea-monsters.</p>

<p>The maskers, on landing, presented their fans. They gave ‘their own
single dance’, and then made ‘choice of their men’ for ‘several
measures and corantoes’. A final dance took them back to their shell.</p>

<p>This was a Queen’s mask, danced by the Queen, the Countesses of
Bedford, Derby, and Suffolk, the Ladies Rich, Bevill, Howard of
Effingham, Wroth, and Walsingham, Lady Elizabeth Howard, Anne Lady
Herbert, and Susan Lady Herbert. The ‘bodily part’ was the ‘design and
act’ of Inigo Jones.</p>

<p>Sir Thomas Edmondes told Lord Shrewsbury on 5 Dec. that the mask was to
cost the Exchequer £3,000 (Lodge, iii. 114). The same sum was stated by
Chamberlain to Winwood on 18 Dec. to have been ‘delivered a month ago’
(Winwood, ii. 41). Molin (<i>V. P.</i> x. 201) reported the amount on
19 Dec. as 25,000 crowns. On 12 Dec. John Packer wrote to Winwood of
the preparations, and after naming some of the maskers added, ‘The Lady
of Northumberland is excused by sickness, Lady Hartford by the measles.
Lady of Nottingham hath<span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">[376]</span> the polypus in her nostril, which some fear
must be cut off. The Lady Hatton would feign have had a part, but some
unknown reason kept her out’ (Winwood, ii. 39). The performance was
described by Carleton to Winwood, as following the creation of Prince
Charles as Duke of York on 6 Jan. (Winwood, ii. 44): ‘At night we had
the Queen’s maske in the Banquetting-House, or rather her pagent. There
was a great engine at the lower end of the room, which had motion,
and in it were the images of sea-horses with other terrible fishes,
which were ridden by Moors: The indecorum was, that there was all
fish and no water. At the further end was a great shell in form of a
skallop, wherein were four seats; on the lowest sat the Queen with my
Lady Bedford; on the rest were placed the Ladies Suffolk, Darby, Rich,
Effingham, Ann Herbert, Susan Herbert, Elizabeth Howard, Walsingham,
and Bevil. Their apparell was rich, but too light and curtizan-like for
such great ones. Instead of vizzards, their faces, and arms up to the
elbows, were painted black, which was disguise sufficient, for they
were hard to be known; but it became them nothing so well as their
red and white, and you cannot imagine a more ugly sight, then a troop
of lean-cheek’d Moors. The Spanish and Venetian ambassadors were both
present, and sate by the King in state, at which Monsieur Beaumont
quarrells so extreamly, that he saith the whole court is Spanish. But
by his favour, he should fall out with none but himself, for they were
all indifferently invited to come as private men, to a private sport;
which he refusing, the Spanish ambassador willingly accepted, and
being there, seeing no cause to the contrary, he put off Don Taxis,
and took upon him El Señor Embaxadour, wherein he outstript our little
Monsieur. He was ... taken out to dance, and footed it like a lusty old
gallant with his country woman. He took out the Queen, and forgot not
to kiss her hand, though there was danger it would have left a mark on
his lips. The night’s work was concluded with a banquet in the great
Chamber, which was so furiously assaulted, that down went table and
tressels before one bit was touched.’ Carleton gives some additional
information in another account, which he sent to Chamberlain on 7 Jan.
(<i>S. P. D. Jac. I</i>, xii. 6, quoted by Sullivan, 28), as that the
‘black faces and hands, which were painted and bare up to the elbowes,
was a very lothsome sight’, and he was ‘sory that strangers should see
owr court so strangely disguised’; that ‘the confusion in getting in
was so great, that some Ladies lie by it and complain of the fury of
the white stafes’; that ‘in the passages through the galleries they
were shutt up in several heapes betwixt dores and there stayed till
all was ended’; and that there were losses ‘of chaynes, jewels, purces
and such like loose ware’. References in letters to one Benson and by
the Earl of Errol to Cecil (<i>S. P. D. Jac. I</i>, xii. 16; xix. 25)
add nothing material. Carleton’s account of the triumph of the Spanish
ambassador is confirmed by reports of the Venetian (<i>V. P.</i> x.
212) and French (<i>B. M. King’s MS.</i> cxxvii, ff. 117, 127<sup>v</sup>, 177<sup>v</sup>;
cf. Sullivan, 196–8) ambassadors. Beaumont had pleaded illness in order
to avoid attending a mask on 27 Dec. 1604 in private, and the Court
chose to assume<span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">[377]</span> that he was still ill on 6 Jan. This gave De Taxis and
Molin an opening to get their private invitations converted into public
ones. Beaumont lost his temper and accused Sir Lewis Lewknor and other
officials of intriguing against him, but he had to accept his defeat.</p>

and quotes from the latter items for ‘framinge and settinge vpp of a
great stage in the banquettinge house xl foote square and iiij<sup>or</sup>
foote in heighte with wheeles to goe on ... framinge and settinge vpp
an other stage’.</p>

<p>Many of the notices of the Queen’s mask also refer to another mask
which was performed ‘among the noblemen and gentlemen’ (Lodge, iii.
114) on 27 Dec. 1604, at the wedding of Sir Philip Herbert and Lady
Susan Vere, daughter of the Earl of Oxford. The bride was herself a
dancer in the Queen’s mask. The wedding mask, the subject of which
was Juno and Hymenaeus, is unfortunately lost. The Revels Accounts
(Cunningham, 204) tell us that it was ‘presented by the Earl of
Pembroke, the Lord Willowbie and 6 Knightes more of the Court’, and
Stowe’s <i>Chronicle</i>, 856, briefly records ‘braue Masks of the
most noble ladies’. Carleton gave Winwood details of the wedding, and
said (Winwood, ii. 43): ‘At night there was a mask in the Hall, which
for conceit and fashion was suitable to the occasion. The actors were
the Earle of Pembrook, the Lord Willoby, Sir Samuel [James?] Hays, Sir
Thomas Germain, Sir Robert Cary, Sir John Lee, Sir Richard Preston,
and Sir Thomas Bager. There was no smal loss that night of chaines
and jewells, and many great ladies were made shorter by the skirts,
and were well enough served that they could keep cut no better.’
Carleton wrote to Chamberlain (<i>S. P. D. Jac. I</i>, xii. 6, quoted
by Sullivan, 25): ‘Theyre conceit was a representacion of Junoes
temple at the lower end of the great hall, which was vawted and within
it the maskers seated with staves of lights about them, and it was
no ill shew. They were brought in by the fower seasons of the yeare
and Hymeneus: which for songs and speaches was as goode as a play.
Theyre apparel was rather costly then cumly; but theyr dancing full
of life and variety; onely S<sup>r</sup> Tho: Germain had lead in his heales
and sometimes forgott what he was doing.’ There was a diplomatic
contretemps on this occasion. At the wedding dinner the Venetian
ambassador Molin was given precedence of the Queen’s brother, the Duke
of Holstein, to the annoyance of the latter. But after dinner Molin was
led to a closet and forgotten there until supper was already begun.
Meanwhile the Duke took his place. There was a personal apology from
the King, and at the mask Molin was given a stool in the royal box to
the right of the King, and the Duke one to the left of the Queen. He
preferred to stand for three hours rather than make use of it (Winwood,
ii. 43; Sullivan, 25; <i>V. P.</i> x. 206).</p>

<p>Carleton wrote to Winwood (ii. 44), ‘They say the Duke of Holst will
come upon us with an after reckoning, and that we shall see him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">[378]</span> on
Candlemas night in a mask, as he hath shewed himself a lusty reveller
all this Christmas’. But if this mask ever took place, nothing is known
of it.</p>

<p>1606. Hymenaei: or The Solemnities of Masque, and Barriers,
Magnificently performed on the eleventh, and twelfth Nights,
from Christmas; At Court: To the auspicious celebrating of the
Marriage-vnion, betweene Robert, Earle of Essex, and the Lady Frances,
second Daughter to the most noble Earle of Suffolke. By Ben: Ionson.
<i>Valentine Sims for Thomas Thorp.</i></p>

<p>1616. Hymenaei, or The solemnities of Masque and Barriers at a
Marriage. [Part of F<sub>1</sub>.]</p>

<p>This was a double mask of eight men and eight women. The men, in
carnation cloth of silver, with variously coloured mantles and watchet
cloth of silver bases, were Humours and Affections; the women, in white
cloth of silver, with carnation and blue undergarments, the Powers of
Juno; the presenters Hymen, with a bride, bridegroom, and bridal train,
Reason, and Order; the musicians the Hours.</p>

<p>The locality was probably the Elizabethan banqueting-house, which seems
to have been repaired in 1604 (Reyher, 340). ‘The scene being drawn’
discovered first an altar for Hymen and ‘a microcosm or globe’, which
turned and disclosed the men maskers in a ‘mine’ or ‘grot’. On either
side of the globe stood great statues of Hercules and Atlas. They bore
up the ‘upper part of the scene’, representing clouds, which opened to
disclose the upper regions, whence the women descended on <i>nimbi</i>.</p>

<p>Each set of maskers had a dance at entry. They then danced together a
measure with strains ‘all notably different, some of them formed into
letters very signifying to the name of the bridegroom’. This done,
they ‘dissolved’ and took forth others for measures, galliards, and
corantoes. After these ‘intermixed dances’ came ‘their last dances’,
and they departed in a bridal procession with an epithalamion.</p>

<p>The mask was in honour of the wedding of the Earl of Essex and Frances
Howard, daughter of the Earl of Suffolk, and was probably given by
their friends. The only Household expenses appear to have been for the
making ready of the room (Reyher, 520), but Lady Rutland’s share seems
to have cost the Earl over £100 (<i>Hist. MSS. Rutland Accounts</i>,
iv. 457). The dancers were the Countesses of Montgomery, Bedford, and
Rutland, the Ladies Knollys, Berkeley, Dorothy Hastings, and Blanch
Somerset, and Mrs. A. Sackville, with the Earls of Montgomery and
Arundel, Lords Willoughby and Howard de Walden, Sir James Hay, Sir
Thomas Howard, Sir Thomas Somerset, and Sir John Ashley. The ‘design
and act’ and the device of the costumes were by Inigo Jones, the songs
by Alphonso Ferrabosco, and the dances by Thomas Giles.</p>

<p>On the next day followed a Barriers, in which, after a dialogue by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">[379]</span>
Jonson between Truth and Opinion, sixteen knights fought on the side of
either disputant (cf. vol. i, p. 146).</p>

<p>The following account was sent by John Pory to Sir Robert Cotton on 7
Jan. (<i>B.M. Cotton MS. Julius</i> C. iii. 301, printed in Goodman,
ii. 124; Collier, i. 350; Birch, i. 42; Sullivan, 199):</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘I haue seen both the mask on Sunday and the barriers on Mundy
night. The Bridegroom carried himself as grauely and gracefully
as if he were of his fathers age. He had greater guiftes giuen
him then my lord Montgomery had, his plate being valued at
3000£ and his jewels, mony and other guiftes at 1600£ more.
But to returne to the maske; both Inigo, Ben, and the actors
men and women did their partes with great commendation. The
conceite or soule of the mask was Hymen bringing in a bride
and Juno pronuba’s priest a bridegroom, proclaiming those two
should be sacrificed to nuptial vnion, and here the poet made
an apostrophe to the vnion of the kingdoms. But before the
sacrifice could be performed, Ben Jonson turned the globe of
the earth standing behind the altar, and within the concaue
sate the 8 men maskers representing the 4 humours and the fower
affections which leapt forth to disturb the sacrifice to vnion;
but amidst their fury Reason that sate aboue them all, crowned
with burning tapers, came down and silenced them. These eight
together with Reason their moderatresse mounted aboue their
heades, sate somewhat like the ladies in the scallop shell the
last year. Aboue the globe of erth houered a middle region of
cloudes in the center wherof stood a grand consort of musicians,
and vpon the cantons or hornes sate the ladies 4 at one corner,
and 4 at another, who descended vpon the stage, not after the
stale downright perpendicular fashion, like a bucket into a
well; but came gently sloping down. These eight, after the
sacrifice was ended, represented the 8 nuptial powers of Juno
pronuba who came downe to confirme the vnion. The men were clad
in crimzon and the weomen in white. They had euery one a white
plume of the richest herons fethers, and were so rich in jewels
vpon their heades as was most glorious. I think they hired and
borrowed all the principal jewels and ropes of perle both in
court and citty. The Spanish ambassador seemed but poore to
the meanest of them. They danced all variety of dances, both
seuerally and promiscue; and then the women took in men as
namely the Prince (who danced with as great perfection and as
setled a maiesty as could be deuised) the Spanish ambassador,
the Archdukes, Ambassador, the Duke, etc., and the men gleaned
out the Queen, the bride, and the greatest of the ladies. The
second night the barriers were as well performed by fifteen
against fifteen; the Duke of Lennox being chieftain on the one
side, and my Lord of Sussex on the other.’</p>

<p>1616. The Second Masque. Which was of Beautie; Was presented in the
same Court, at White-Hall, on the Sunday night after the Twelfth Night.
1608. [Part of F<sub>1</sub>.] The maskers, in orange-tawny and silver and
green and silver, were the twelve Daughters of Niger of the Mask of
Blackness, now laved white, with four more; the torchbearers Cupids;
the presenters January, Boreas, Vulturnus, Thamesis; the musicians
Echoes and Shades of old Poets.</p>

<p>The locality was the new banqueting-house at Whitehall. January was
throned in midst of the house. The curtain, representing Night,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">[380]</span>
was drawn to discover the maskers on a Throne of Beauty, borne by a
floating isle.</p>

<p>The maskers gave two dances, which were repeated at the King’s request,
and then danced ‘with the lords’. They danced galliards and corantoes.
They then gave a third dance, and a fourth, which took them into their
throne again.</p>

<p>This was a Queen’s mask, danced by the Queen, Arabella Stuart, the
Countesses of Arundel, Derby, Bedford, and Montgomery, and the Ladies
Elizabeth Guildford, Katherine Petre, Anne Winter, Windsor, Anne
Clifford, Mary Neville, Elizabeth Hatton, Elizabeth Gerard, Chichester,
and Walsingham. The torchbearers were ‘chosen out of the best and
ingenious youth of the Kingdom’. The scene was ‘put in act’ by the
King’s master carpenter. Thomas Giles made the dances and played
Thamesis.</p>

<p>The mask was announced by 9 Dec. (<i>V. P.</i> xi. 74). On 10 Dec. La
Boderie (ii. 490) reported that it would cost 6,000 or 7,000 crowns,
and that nearly all the ladies invited by the Queen to take part in it
were Catholics. Anne’s preparations were in swing before 17 Dec. (<i>V.
P.</i> xi. 76). On 22 Dec. La Boderie reported (iii. 6) that he had
underestimated the cost, which would not be less than 30,000 crowns,
and was causing much annoyance to the Privy Council. On 31 Dec. Donne
(<i>Letters</i>, i. 182) intended to deliver a letter ‘when the rage
of the mask is past’. Lord Arundel notes his wife’s practising early
in Jan. (Lodge, App. 124). The original date was 6 Jan. ‘The Mask goes
forward for Twelfth-day’, wrote Chamberlain to Carleton on 5 Jan.
(<i>S. P. D. Jac. I</i>, xxxi. 2; Birch, i. 69), ‘though I doubt the
new room will be scant ready’. But on 8 Jan. (<i>S. P. D. Jac. I</i>,
xxxi. 4; Birch, i. 71) he wrote again:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘We had great hopes of having you here this day, and then I
would not have given my part of the mask for any of their
places that shall be present, for I suppose you and your lady
would find easily passage, being so befriended; for the show is
put off till Sunday, by reason that all things are not ready.
Whatsoever the device may be, and what success they may have in
their dancing, yet you would have been sure to have seen great
riches in jewels, when one lady, and that under a baroness, is
said to be furnished far better then a hundred thousand pounds.
And the Lady Arabella goes beyond her; and the queen must not
come behind.’</p>
</div>

<p class="p-left">The delay was really due to ambassadorial complications, which are
reported by Giustinian (<i>V. P.</i> xi. 83, 86) and very fully by La
Boderie (iii. 1–75; cf. Sullivan, 35, 201). The original intention was
to invite the Spanish and Venetian, but not the French and Flemish
ambassadors. This, according to Giustinian, offended La Boderie,
because Venice was ‘the nobler company’. But the real sting lay in
the invitation to Spain. This was represented to La Boderie about 23
Dec. as the personal act of Anne, in the face of a remonstrance by
James on the ground of the preference already shown to Spain in 1605.
La Boderie replied that he had already been slighted at the King of
Denmark’s visit, that the mask was a public occasion, and that Henri
would certainly hold James responsible. A few days later<span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">[381]</span> he was told
that James was greatly annoyed at his wife’s levity, and would ask
him and the Venetian ambassador to dinner; but La Boderie refused to
accept this as a compliment equivalent to seeing the Queen dance,
and supping with the King before 10,000 persons. He urged that both
ambassadors or neither should be invited, and hinted that, if Anne was
so openly Spanish in her tendencies, Henri might feel obliged to leave
the mission in charge of a secretary. An offer was made to invite La
Boderie’s wife, but this he naturally refused. The Council tried in
vain to make Anne hear reason, but finally let the mask proceed, and
countered Henri diplomatically by calling his attention to the money
debts due from France to England. Meanwhile Giustinian had pressed for
his own invitation in place of the Flemish ambassador, and obtained it.
The Spanish and Venetian ambassadors were therefore present. La Boderie
reported that much attention was paid to Giustinian, and little to the
Spanish ambassador, and also that James was so angry with Anne that he
left for a hunting trip the next day without seeing her. Giustinian
admired the mask, which was, James told him (<i>V. P.</i> xi. 86), ‘to
consecrate the birth of the Great Hall, which his predecessors had
left him built merely in wood, but which he had converted into stone’.
Probably this is the mask described in a letter of Lady Pembroke to
Lord Shrewsbury calendared without date among letters of 1607–8 in
Lodge, iii, App. 121. On 28 Jan. the Spanish ambassador invited the
fifteen ladies who had danced to dinner (Lodge, iii. 223; La Boderie,
iii. 81). On 29 Jan. Lord Lisle wrote to the Earl of Shrewsbury
regretting that he could not send him the verses, because Ben Jonson
was busy writing more for the Haddington wedding (Lodge, App. 102).</p>

<p>A warrant for expenses was signed 11 Dec. (<i>S. P. D. Jac. I</i>,
xxviii). A payment was made to Bethell (Reyher, 520).</p>

<p>1616. [Part of F<sub>1</sub>.] The maskers were the twelve Signs of the Zodiac
in carnation and silver; the antimaskers Cupid and twelve Joci and
Risus, who danced ‘with their antic faces’; the presenters Venus, the
Graces and Cupid, Hymen, Vulcan and the Cyclopes; the musicians Priests
of Hymen, while the Cyclopes beat time with their sledges.</p>

<p>Pilasters hung with amorous trophies supported gigantic figures of
Triumph and Victory ‘in place of the arch, and holding a gyrlond of
myrtle for the key’. The scene was a steep red cliff (Radcliffe), over
which clouds broke for the issue of the chariot of Venus. After the
antimasque, the cliff parted, to discover the maskers in a turning
sphere of silver. The maskers gave four dances, interspersed with
verses of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">[382]</span> an epithalamion. The mask was given by the maskers, seven
Scottish and five English lords and gentlemen, the Duke of Lennox,
the Earls of Arundel, Pembroke, and Montgomery, Lords D’Aubigny, De
Walden, Hay, and Sanquhar, the Master of Mar, Sir Robert Rich, Sir John
Kennedy, and Mr. Erskine. (Quarto and Lodge, iii. 223.) The ‘device and
act of the scene’ were supplied by Inigo Jones, the tunes by Alphonso
Ferrabosco, and two dances each by Hierome Herne and Thomas Giles, who
also beat time as Cyclopes.</p>

<p>Rowland White told Lord Shrewsbury on 26 Jan. that the mask was ‘now
the only thing thought upon at court’, and would cost the maskers about
£300 a man (Lodge, iii. 223). Jonson was busy with the verses on 29
Jan. (Lodge, App. 102).</p>

<p>Sussex and Haddington intended to ask the French ambassador both
to the wedding dinner and to the mask and banquet, but the Lord
Chamberlain, having Spanish sympathies, would not consent. In the end
he was asked by James himself to the mask and banquet, at which Prince
Henry would preside. He accepted, and suggested that Henri should
present Haddington with a ring, but this was not done. He thought the
mask ‘assez maigre’, but Anne was very gracious, and James regretted
that etiquette did not allow him to sit at the banquet in person. La
Boderie’s wife and daughter, who danced with the Duke of York, were
also present. Unfortunately he did not receive in time an instruction
from Paris to keep away if the Flemish ambassador was asked, and did
not protest against this invitation on his own responsibility, partly
out of annoyance with the Venetian for attending the Queen’s mask
without him, and partly for fear of losing his own invitation. The
Fleming had had far less consideration than himself (La Boderie, iii.
75–144). So both the French and the Flemish ambassador were present,
with two princes of Saxony (<i>V. P.</i> xi. 97).</p>

<p>English criticisms were more kindly than La Boderie’s. Sir Henry
Saville described it to Sir Richard Beaumont on the same night as a
‘singular brave mask’, at which he had been until three in the morning
(<i>Beaumont Papers</i>, 17), and Chamberlain wrote to Carleton on 11
Feb. (<i>S. P. D. Jac. I</i>, xxxi. 26; Birch, i. 72): ‘I can send you
no perfect relation of the marriage nor mask on Tuesday, only they say
all, but especially the motions, were well performed; as Venus, with
her chariot drawn by swans, coming in a cloud to seek her son; who
with his companions, Lusus, Risus, and Janus [? Jocus], and four or
five more wags, were dancing a matachina, and acted it very antiquely,
before the twelve signs, who were the master maskers, descended from
the zodiac, and played their parts more gravely, being very gracefully
attired.’</p>

<p><i>Edition</i> in J. P. Collier, <i>Five Court Masques</i> (1848,
<i>Sh. Soc.</i> from <i>Royal MS.</i>).</p>

<p>Jonson prefaces that ‘because Her Majesty (best knowing that a
principal part of life in these spectacles lay in their variety) had
commanded me to think on some dance, or shew, that might precede
hers, and have the place of a foil, or false masque: I was careful
to decline, not only from others, but mine own steps in that kind,
since the last year, I had an antimasque of boys; and therefore now
devised that twelve women, in the habit of hags or witches, sustaining
the persons of Ignorance, Suspicion, Credulity, &amp;c., the opposites to
good Fame, should fill that part, not as a masque, but as a spectacle
of strangeness’ [it is called a ‘maske’ in the programme] ‘producing
multiplicity of gesture, and not unaptly sorting with the current and
whole fall of the device’.</p>

<p>The maskers, in various habits, eight designs for which are in <i>Sh.
England</i>, ii. 311, were Bel-Anna and eleven other Queens, who were
attended by torchbearers; the antimaskers eleven Hags and their dame
Ate; the presenters Perseus or Heroic Virtue and Fame.</p>

<p>The locality was the new banqueting-house at Whitehall (<i>T. of C.
Acct.</i>, quoted by Sullivan, 54). The scene at first represented a
Hell, whence the antimask issued. In the middle of a ‘magical dance’
it vanished at a blast of music, ‘and the whole face of the scene
altered’, becoming the House of Fame, a ‘<i>machina versatilis</i>’,
which showed first Perseus and the maskers and then Fame. Descending,
the maskers made their entry in three chariots, to which the Hags were
bound. They danced their first and second dances; then ‘took out the
men, and danced the measures’ for nearly an hour. After an interval for
a song, came their third dance, ‘graphically disposed into letters,
and honouring the name of the most sweet and ingenious Prince, Charles
Duke of York’. Galliards and corantoes followed, and after their ‘last
dance’ they returned in their chariots to the House of Fame.</p>

<p>This was a Queen’s mask, danced by the Queen, the Countesses of
Arundel, Derby, Huntingdon, Bedford, Essex, and Montgomery, the
Viscountess Cranborne, and the Ladies Elizabeth Guildford, Anne Winter,
Windsor, and Anne Clifford. Inigo Jones was responsible for the attire
of the Hags, and ‘the invention and architecture of the whole scene and
machine’; Alphonso Ferrabosco for the airs of the songs; Thomas Giles
for the third dance, and Hierome Herne for the dance of Hags. John
Allen, ‘her Majesty’s servant’, sang a ditty between the measures and
the third dance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">[384]</span></p>

<p>As early as 14 Nov. Donne wrote to Sir Henry Goodyere (<i>Letters</i>,
i. 199), ‘The King ... hath left with the Queen a commandment to
meditate upon a masque for Christmas, so that they grow serious about
that already’. The performance was originally intended for 6 Jan.
(<i>V. P.</i> xi. 219), but on 10 Jan. Chamberlain wrote to Carleton
(Birch, i. 87), ‘The mask at court is put off till Candlemas, as it
is thought the Spaniard may be gone, for the French ambassador hath
been so long and so much neglected, that it is doubted more would
not be well endured’. The intrigues which determined this delay are
described in the diplomatic correspondence of the French and Venetian
ambassadors (La Boderie, iv. 104, 123, 136, 145, 175, 228; <i>V.
P.</i> xi. 212, 219, 222, 231, 234; cf. Sullivan, 47, 212). Hints of a
<i>rapprochement</i> between France and Spain had made James anxious
to conciliate Henri IV. Even Anne had learnt discretion, and desired
that La Boderie should be present at the mask. He was advised by
Salisbury to ask for an invitation, which he did, through his wife and
Lady Bedford. He had instructions from Henri to retire from Court and
leave a secretary in charge if his master’s dignity was compromised.
Unfortunately the Spanish ambassador leiger was reinforced by an
ambassador extraordinary, Don Fernandez de Girone, and took advantage
of this to press on his side for an invitation. Etiquette gave a
precedence to ambassadors extraordinary, and all that could be done
was to wait until Don Fernandez was gone. This was not until 1 Feb. La
Boderie was at the mask, and treated with much courtesy. He excused
himself from dancing, but the Duke of York took out his daughter,
and he supped with the King and the princes. He found the mask ‘fort
riche, et s’il m’est loisible de le dire, plus superbe qu’ingenieux’.
He also thought that of the ‘intermédes’ there were ‘trop et d’assez
tristes’. The Spanish influence, however, was sufficiently strong, when
exercised on behalf of Flanders, to disappoint the Venetian ambassador
of a promised invitation, and La Boderie was the only diplomatic
representative present. Anne asked Correr to come privately, but this
he would not do, and she said she should trouble herself no more about
masks.</p>

<p>It was at first intended to limit the cost of the mask to £1,000, but
on 27 Nov. Sir Thomas Lake wrote to Salisbury that the King would allow
a ‘reasonable encrease’ upon this, and had agreed that certain lords
should sign and allow bills for the charges (<i>S. P. D. Jac. I</i>,
xxxvii. 96, printed and misdated 1607 in Sullivan, 201). This duty
was apparently assigned to Lord Suffolk as Lord Chamberlain and Lord
Worcester as Master of the Horse, in whose names a warrant was issued
on 1 Dec. (<i>S. P. D. Jac. I</i>, xxxviii. 1). The financial documents
cited by Reyher, 520, suggest that the actual payments passed through
the hands of Inigo Jones and Henry Reynolds. Reyher, 72, reckons the
total cost at near £5,000. This seems very high. A contemporary writer,
W. Ffarrington (<i>Chetham Soc.</i> xxxix. 151), gives the estimate of
‘them that had a hand in the business as “at the leaste two thousand
pounde”’.</p>

of the cock, to disclose ‘the nation of Faies’, with the maskers on
‘sieges’ and Oberon in a chariot drawn by two white bears. ‘The lesser
Faies’ danced; then came a first and second ‘masque-dance’, then
‘measures, corantos, galliards, etc.’, and finally a ‘last dance into
the work’.</p>

<p>This was a Prince’s mask, and clearly Henry was Oberon, but the names
of the other maskers are not preserved.</p>

<p>Henry’s preparation for a mask is mentioned on 15 Nov. by Correr,
who reports that he would have liked it to be on horseback, if James
had consented (<i>V. P.</i> xii. 79), on 3 Dec. by Thomas Screven
(<i>Rutland MSS.</i> iv. 211), ‘The Prince is com to St. James and
prepareth for a mask’, and on 15 Dec. by John More (Winwood, iii. 239),
‘Yet doth the Prince make but one mask’.</p>

<p>The diplomatic tendency at this time was to detach France from growing
relations from Spain, and it was intended that both the masks of the
winter 1610–11 should serve to entertain the Marshal de Laverdin,
expected as ambassador extraordinary from Paris for the signature of a
treaty. But the Regent Marie de Médicis was not anxious to emphasize
the occasion, and the Marshal did not arrive in time for the Prince’s
mask, which took place on 1 Jan. ‘It looked’, says Correr, ‘as though
he did not understand the honour done him by the King and the Prince.’
The Spanish and Venetian ambassadors were therefore invited, and were
present. The Dutch ambassador was invited, but professed illness, to
avoid complications with the Spaniard. Correr found the mask ‘very
beautiful throughout, very decorative, but most remarkable for the
grace of the Prince’s every movement’ (<i>Rutland MSS.</i> i. 426;
<i>V. P.</i> xii. 101, 106; cf. Sullivan, 61).</p>

<p>None of the above notices in fact identify Henry’s mask of 1 Jan.
1611 with the undated <i>Oberon</i>, but proof is forthcoming from
an Exchequer payment of May 1611 for ‘the late Princes barriers and
masks’ (text in Reyher, 511) which specifies ‘the Satires and faeries’.
The amount was £247 9<i>s.</i>, and the items include payments to
composers, musicians, and players. We learn that [Robert] Johnson
and [Thomas] Giles provided the dances, and Alphonse [Ferrabosco]
singers and lutenists, that the violins were Thomas Lupo the elder,
Alexander Chisan, and Rowland Rubidge, and that ‘xiij<sup>n</sup> Holt boyes’
were employed, presumably as fays. There is a sum of £15 for ‘players<span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">[386]</span>
imployed in the maske’ and £15 more for ‘players imployed in the
barriers’, about which barriers no more is known. This account,
subscribed by Sir Thomas Chaloner, by no means exhausts the expense
of the mask. Other financial documents (Devon, 131, 134, 136; cf.
Reyher, 521) show payments of £40 each to Jonson and Inigo Jones, and
£20 each to Ferrabosco, Jerome Herne, and Confess. These were from the
Exchequer. An additional £16 to Inigo Jones ‘devyser for the saide
maske’ fell upon Henry’s privy purse, together with heavy bills to
mercers and other tradesmen, amounting to £1,076 6<i>s.</i> 10<i>d.</i>
(Cunningham, viii, from <i>Audit Office Declared Accts.</i>). Correr
had reported on 22 Nov. that neither of the masks of this winter was
to ‘be so costly as last year’s, which to say sooth was excessively
costly’ (<i>V. P.</i> xii. 86). The anticipation can hardly have
been fulfilled. I suppose that ‘last year’s’ means the <i>Tethys’
Festival</i> of June 1610, as no mask during the winter of 1609–10 is
traceable.</p>

<p>1616. A Masque of her Maiesties. Love freed from Ignorance and Folly.
<i>W. Stansby, sold by Richard Meighen.</i> [Part of F<sub>1</sub>.]</p>

<p>The maskers were eleven Daughters of the Morn, led by the Queen of the
Orient; the antimaskers twelve Follies or She-Fools; the presenters
Cupid and Ignorance, a Sphinx; the musicians twelve Priests of the
Muses, who also danced a measure, and three Graces, with others.</p>

<p>The locality was probably the banqueting-hall. The scene is not
described. There were two ‘masque-dances’, with ‘measures and revels’
between them. This was a Queen’s mask, but the names of the maskers are
not preserved.</p>

<p>John More wrote on 15 Dec. (Winwood, iii. 239), ‘Yet doth the Prince
make but one mask, and the Queen but two, which doth cost her majesty
but £600.’ Perhaps the writer was mistaken. Anne had not given more
than one mask in any winter, nor is there any trace of a second in
that of 1610–11. Correr, on 22 Nov., anticipates one only, not to be
so costly as last year’s. It was to precede the Prince’s. It was,
however, put off to Twelfth Night, and then again to Candlemas, ‘either
because the stage machinery is not in order, or because their Majesties
thought it well to let the Marshal depart first’. This was Marshal de
Laverdin, whose departure from France as ambassador extraordinary was
delayed (cf. <i>Mask of Oberon</i>). He was present at the mask when it
actually took place on 3 Feb., the day after Candlemas. Apparently the
Venetian ambassador was also invited. (<i>V. P.</i> xii. 86, 101, 106,
110, 115.)</p>

<p>Several financial documents bearing on the mask exist (<i>S. P. D.
Jac. I</i>, lvii, Nov.; Devon, 135; Reyher, 509, 521), and show that
the contemplated £600 was in fact exceeded. An account signed by the
Earls of Suffolk and Worcester, to whom the oversight of the charges
was doubtless assigned as Household officers, shows that in addition
to £600 14<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> spent in defraying the bills of Inigo
Jones and others and in rewards, there was a further expenditure of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">[387]</span>
£118 7<i>s.</i> by the Wardrobe, and even then no items are included
for the dresses of the main maskers, which were probably paid for
by the wearers. The rewards include £2 each to five boys who played
the Graces, Sphinx, and Cupid, and £1 each to the twelve Fools. This
enables us to identify Jonson’s undated mask with that of 1611. Ben
Jonson and Inigo Jones had £40 each; Alphonso [Ferrabosco] £20 for the
songs; [Robert] Johnson and Thomas Lupo £5 each for setting the songs
to lutes and setting the dances to violins, and Confess and Bochan £50
and £20 for teaching the dances.</p>

<p>1616. Love Restored, In a Masque at Court, by Gentlemen the Kings
Seruants. <i>W. Stansby, sold by Richard Meighen.</i> [Part of F<sub>1</sub>.]</p>

<p>The maskers were the ten Ornaments of Court&mdash;Honour, Courtesy, Valour,
Urbanity, Confidence, Alacrity, Promptness, Industry, Hability,
Reality; the presenters Masquerado, Plutus, Robin Goodfellow, and
Cupid, who entered in a chariot attended by the maskers. There were
three dances. Jonson’s description is exceptionally meagre.</p>

<p>The dialogue finds its humour in the details of mask-presentation
themselves. Masquerado, in his vizard, apologizes for the absence of
musicians and the hoarseness of ‘the rogue play-boy, that acts Cupid’.
Plutus criticizes the expense and the corruption of manners involved in
masks. Robin Goodfellow narrates his difficulties in obtaining access.
He has tried in vain to get through the Woodyard on to the Terrace, but
the Guard pushed him off a ladder into the Verge. The Carpenters’ way
also failed him. He has offered, or thought of offering, himself as an
‘enginer’ belonging to the ‘motions’, but they were ‘ceased’; as an
old tire-woman; as a musician; as a feather-maker of Blackfriars; as a
‘bombard man’, carrying ‘bouge’ to country ladies who had fasted for
the fine sight since seven in the morning; as a citizen’s wife, exposed
to the liberties of the ‘black-guard’; as a wireman or a chandler; and
finally in his own shape as ‘part of the Device’.</p>

<p>There are several financial documents relating to a mask at Christmas
1611, for which funds were issued to one Meredith Morgan (<i>S. P. D.
Jac. I</i>, lxvii, Dec.; lxviii, Jan.; Reyher, 521). The Revels Account
(Cunningham, 211) records a ‘princes Mask performed by Gentelmen of
his High [&emsp;&emsp;]’ on 6 Jan. 1612. According to Chamberlain, the
Queen was at Greenwich ‘practising for a new mask’ on 20 Nov., but this
was put off in December as ‘unseasonable’ so soon after the death of
the Queen of Spain (Birch, i. 148, 152). Jonson does not date <i>Love
Restored</i>, but Dr. Brotanek has successfully assigned it to 1611–12
on the ground of its reference to ‘the Christmas cut-purse’, of whom
Chamberlain wrote to Carleton on 31 Dec. 1611 that ‘a cut-purse,
taken in the Chapel Royal, will be executed’ (Brotanek, 347; cf.
<i>S. P. D. Jac. I</i>, lxvii. 117, and <i>Bartholomew Fair</i>
(1614), <span class="allsmcap">III.</span> v. 132). This was one John Selman, executed
on 7 Jan. 1612 for picking the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">[388]</span> pocket of Leonard Barry, servant to
Lord Harington, on Christmas Day (Rye, 269). I may add that Robin
Goodfellow, when pretending to be concerned with the motions, was asked
if he were ‘the fighting bear of last year’, and that the chariot of
Oberon on 1 Jan. 1611 was drawn by white bears. There is, of course,
nothing inconsistent in a Prince’s mask being performed by King’s
servants, and the ‘High[ness]’ of the Revels Account may mean James,
just as well as Henry. Simpson (<i>E. M.</i> 1. xxxiv) puts <i>Love
Restored</i> in 1613–14, as connected with the tilt (cf. p. 393), but
there is no room for it (cf. p. 246).</p>



<p class="center p1"><i>The Irish Mask. 29 Dec. 1613</i></p>

<p>1616. The Irish Masque at Court, by Gentlemen the Kings Servants. <i>W.
Stansby, sold by Richard Meighen.</i> [Part of F<sub>1</sub>.]</p>

<p>The maskers were twelve Irish Gentlemen, first in mantles, then
without; the antimaskers their twelve Footmen; the presenters a Citizen
and a Gentleman; one of the musicians an Irish bard. The Footmen dance
‘to the bag-pipe and other rude music’, after which the Gentlemen
‘dance forth’ twice.</p>

<p>The antimaskers say that their lords have come to the bridal of ‘ty
man Robyne’ to the daughter of ‘Toumaish o’ Shuffolke’, who has
knocked them on the pate with his ‘phoyt stick’, as they came by.
There are also compliments to ‘King Yamish’, ‘my Mistresh tere’, ‘my
little Maishter’, and ‘te vfrow, ty daughter, tat is in Tuchland’. It
is therefore easy to supply the date which Jonson omits, as the mask
clearly belongs to the series presented in honour of the wedding of
Robert Earl of Somerset with the Earl of Suffolk’s daughter during
the Christmas of 1613–14. The list in Stowe, <i>Annales</i>, 928 (cf.
s.v. Campion), includes one on 29 Dec. by ‘the Prince’s Gentlemen,
which pleased the King so well that hee caused them to performe it
againe uppon the Monday following’. This was 3 Jan.; the 10 Jan. in
Nichols, ii. 718, is a misreading of the evidence in Chamberlain’s
letters, which identify the mask as Jonson’s by a notice of the Irish
element. On 30 Dec. Chamberlain wrote to Alice Carleton (Birch, i.
285), ‘yesternight there was a medley mask of five English and five
Scots, which are called the high dancers, amongst whom Sergeant Boyd,
one Abercrombie, and Auchternouty, that was at Padua and Venice, are
esteemed the most principal and lofty, but how it succeeded I know
not’. Later in the letter he added, probably in reference to this and
not Campion’s mask, ‘Sir William Bowyer hath lost his eldest son, Sir
Henry. He was a fine dancer, and should have been of the masque, but
overheating himself with practising, he fell into the smallpox and
died.’ On 5 Jan. he wrote to Dudley Carleton (Birch, i. 287), ‘The&mdash;&mdash;
maskers were so well liked at court the last week that they were
appointed to perform again on Monday: yet their device, which was a
mimical imitation of the Irish, was not pleasing to many, who think it
no time, as the case stands, to exasperate that nation, by making it
ridiculous’. On the finance cf. s.v. Campion.</p>

<p>The maskers were twelve Sons of Nature; the first antimaskers
Alchemists, the second Imperfect Creatures, in helms of limbecs; the
presenters Vulcan, Cyclops, Mercury, Nature, and Prometheus, with a
chorus of musicians.</p>

<p>The locality was doubtless Whitehall. The scene first discovered was
a laboratory. After the antimasks it changed to a bower, whence the
maskers descended for ‘the first dance’, ‘the main dance’, and, after
dancing with the ladies, ‘their last dance’. Donne (<i>Letters</i>,
ii. 65) wrote to Sir Henry Goodyere on 13 Dec. [1614], ‘They are
preparing for a masque of gentlemen, in which M<sup>r</sup>. Villiers is and M<sup>r</sup>.
Karre whom I told you before my Lord Chamberlain had brought into the
bedchamber’. On 18 Dec. [1614] (ii. 66) he adds, ‘M<sup>r</sup>. Villiers ...
is here, practising for the masque’. The year-dates can be supplied
by comparison with Chamberlain’s letters to Carleton. On 1 Dec. 1614
(<i>S. P. D. Jac. I</i>, lxxviii. 65) Chamberlain wrote, ‘And yet for
all this penurious world we speake of a maske this Christmas toward
which the King gives 1500£ the principall motiue wherof is thought to
be the gracing of younge Villers and to bring him on the stage’. It
should be borne in mind that there was at this time an intrigue amongst
the Court party opposed to Somerset and the Howards, including Donne’s
patroness Lady Bedford, to put forward George Villiers, afterwards Duke
of Buckingham, as a rival to the Earl of Somerset in the good graces
of James I. On 5 Jan. Chamberlain wrote again (<i>S. P. D. Jac. I</i>,
lxxx. 1; Birch, i. 290, but there misdated), ‘Tomorrow night there
is a mask at court, but the common voice and preparations promise so
little, that it breeds no great expectation’; and on 12 Jan. (<i>S. P.
D.</i> lxxx. 4; Birch, i. 356), ‘The only matter I can advertise ...
is the success of the mask on Twelfth Night, which was so well liked
and applauded, that the King had it represented again the Sunday night
after [8 Jan.] in the very same manner, though neither in device nor
show was there anything extraordinary, but only excellent dancing;
the choice being made of the best, both English and Scots’. He then
describes an ambassadorial incident, which is also detailed in a report
by Foscarini (<i>V. P.</i> xiii. 317) and by Finett, 19 (cf. Sullivan,
95). The Spanish ambassador refused to appear in public with the Dutch
ambassador, although it was shown that his predecessor had already done
so, and in the end both withdrew. The Venetian ambassador and Tuscan
agent were alone present. An invitation to the French ambassador does
not appear to have been in question.</p>

<p>Financial documents (Reyher, 523; <i>S. P. D.</i> lxxx, Mar.) show that
one Walter James received Exchequer funds for the mask.</p>

<p>I am not quite sure that Brotanek, 351, is right in identifying
<i>Mercury Vindicated</i> with the mask of January 1615 and <i>The
Golden Age Restored</i> with that of January 1616, but the evidence is
so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_390">[390]</span> inconclusive that it is not worth while to disturb his chronology.
<i>Mercury Vindicated</i> is not dated in the Folio, but it is printed
next before <i>The Golden Age Restored</i>, which is dated ‘1615’.
Now it is true that the order of the Folio, as Brotanek points out,
appears to be chronological; but it is also true that, at any rate for
the masks, the year-dates, by a practice characteristic of Jonson,
follow Circumcision and not Annunciation style. One or other principle
seems to have been disregarded at the end of the Folio, and who shall
say which? Brotanek attempts to support his arrangement by tracing
topical allusions (<i>a</i>) in <i>Mercury Vindicated</i> to Court
‘brabbles’ of 1614–15, (<i>b</i>) in <i>The Golden Age Restored</i>
to the Somerset <i>esclandre</i>. But there are always ‘brabbles’ in
courts, and I can find no references to Somerset at all. Nor is it in
the least likely that there would be any. <i>Per contra</i>, I may
note that Chamberlain’s description of the ‘device’ in 1615 as not
‘extraordinary’ applies better to <i>The Golden Age Restored</i> than
to <i>Mercury Vindicated</i>.</p>

<p>The maskers were Sons of Phoebus, Chaucer, Gower, Lydgate, Spenser, and
presumably others; the antimaskers twelve Evils; the presenters Pallas,
Astraea, the Iron Age, and the Golden Age, with a chorus of musicians.</p>

<p>The locality was doubtless Whitehall. Pallas descended, and the Evils
came from a cave, danced to ‘two drums, trumpets, and a confusion of
martial music’, and were turned to statues. The scene changed, and
later the scene of light was discovered. After ‘the first dance’ and
‘the main dance’, the maskers danced with the ladies, and then danced
‘the galliards and corantos’.</p>

<p>Finett, 31 (cf. Sullivan, 237), tells us that ‘The King being desirous
that the French, Venetian, and Savoyard ambassadors should all be
invited to a maske at court prepared for New-years night, an exception
comming from the French, was a cause of deferring their invitation
till Twelfe night, when the Maske was to be re-acted, ... [They] were
received at eight of the clock, the houre assigned (no supper being
prepared for them, as at other times, to avoid the trouble incident)
and were conducted to the privy gallery by the Lord Chamberlaine and
the Lord Danvers appointed (an honour more than had been formerly
done to Ambassadors Ordinary) to accompany them, the Master of the
Ceremonies being also present. They were all there placed at the maske
on the Kings right hand (not right out, but byas forward) first and
next to the King the French, next him the Venetian, and next him the
Savoyard. At his Majesties left hand sate the Queen, and next her the
Prince. The maske being ended, they followed his Majesty to a banquet
in the presence, and returned by the way they entered: the followers
of the French were placed in a seate reserved for them above over
the Kings right hand; the others in one on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_391">[391]</span> left. The Spanish
ambassadors son, and the agent of the Arch-Duke (who invited himselfe)
were bestowed on the forme where the Lords sit, next beneath the
Barons, English, Scotish, and Irish as the sonns of the Ambassador of
Venice, and of Savoy had been placed the maske night before, but were
this night placed with their countreymen in the gallery mentioned.’</p>

<p>Financial documents (Reyher, 523; <i>S. P. D.</i> lxxxix. 104) show
Exchequer payments for the mask to Edmund Sadler and perhaps Meredith
Morgan.</p>

inscribed ‘St. George’s Portico’. Merlin tells the tale of English

<p>Jonson does not date the piece, but it stands in F<sub>1</sub> between the
<i>Masque of Queens</i> (2 Feb. 1609) and <i>Oberon</i> (1 Jan. 1611),
and this, with the use of the name Meliadus, enables us to attach
it to the barriers of 6 Jan. 1610, of which there is ample record
(Stowe, <i>Annales</i>, 574; Cornwallis, <i>Life of Henry</i>, 12;
Birch, i. 102; Winwood, iii. 117; <i>V. P.</i> xi. 400, 403, 406, 410,
414). It was Henry’s first public appearance in arms, and he had some
difficulty in obtaining the King’s consent, but His Majesty did not
wish to cross him. The challenge, speeches for which are summarized by
Cornwallis, was on 31 Dec. in the presence-chamber, and until 6 Jan.
Henry kept open table at St. James’s at a cost of £100 a day. With
him as challengers were the Duke of Lennox, the Earls of Arundel and
Southampton, Lord Hay, Sir Thomas Somerset, and Sir Richard Preston.
There were fifty-eight defendants, of whom prizes were adjudged to the
Earl of Montgomery, Thomas Darcy, and Sir Robert Gordon. Each bout
consisted of two pushes with the pike and twelve sword-strokes, and
the young prince gave or received that night thirty-two pushes and
about 360 strokes. Drummond of Hawthornden, who called his elegy on
Henry <i>Tears on the Death of Moeliades</i>, explains the name as an
anagram, <i>Miles a Deo</i>.</p>

a chariot, with a company of ten knights, of whom the Bride’s were
challengers, and introduced and followed the tilting with speeches.
Finally, Hymen resolved the dispute.</p>

<p>This tilt was on 1 Jan. 1614, after the wedding of the Earl of Somerset
on 26 Dec. 1613, as is clearly shown by a letter of Chamberlain (Birch,
i. 287). The bride’s colours were murrey and white, the bridegroom’s
green and yellow. The tilters included the Duke of Lennox, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_394">[394]</span>

<p class="center p1"><i>Lost Entertainment</i></p>

<p>When James dined with the Merchant Taylors on 16 July 1607 (cf. ch.
iv), Jonson wrote a speech of eighteen verses, for recitation by an
Angel of Gladness. This ‘pleased his Majesty marvelously well’, but
does not seem to have been preserved (Nichols, <i>James</i>, ii. 136;

<p class="p-left p2">THOMAS KYD (1558–94).</p>

<p>Kyd was baptized on 6 Nov. 1558. His father, Francis Kyd, was a
London citizen and a scrivener. John Kyd, a stationer, may have been
a relative. Thomas entered the Merchant Taylors School in 1565, but
there is no evidence that he proceeded to a university. It is possible
that he followed his father’s profession before he drifted into
literature. He seems to be criticized as translator and playwright in
Nashe’s Epistle to Greene’s <i>Menaphon</i> in 1589 (cf. App. C), and
a reference there has been rather rashly interpreted as implying that
he was the author of an early play on Hamlet. About the same time his
reputation was made by <i>The Spanish Tragedy</i>, which came, with
<i>Titus Andronicus</i>, to be regarded as the typical drama of its
age. Ben Jonson couples ‘sporting Kyd’ with ‘Marlowe’s mighty line’
in recording the early dramatists outshone by Shakespeare. Towards
the end of his life Kyd’s relations with Marlowe brought him into
trouble. During the years 1590–3 he was in the service of a certain
noble lord for whose players Marlowe was in the habit of writing. The
two sat in the same room and certain ‘atheistic’ papers of Marlowe’s
got mixed up with Kyd’s. On 12 May 1593 Kyd was arrested on a suspicion
of being concerned in certain ‘lewd and mutinous libels’ set up on
the wall of the Dutch churchyard; the papers were discovered and led
to Marlowe (q.v.) being arrested also. Kyd, after his release, wrote
to the Lord Keeper, Sir John Puckering, to repudiate the charge of
atheism and to explain away his apparent intimacy with Marlowe. It is
not certain who the ‘lord’ with whom the two writers were connected may
have been; possibly Lord Pembroke or Lord Strange, for whose players
Marlowe certainly wrote; possibly also Henry Radcliffe, fourth Earl
of Sussex, to whose daughter-in-law Kyd dedicated his translation of
<i>Cornelia</i>, after his disgrace, in 1594. Before the end of 1594
Kyd had died intestate in the parish of St. Mary Colchurch, and his
parents renounced the administration of his goods.</p>

Thomas Kyd’s Spanish Tragedy</i> (1896).</p>

<p>Kyd’s authorship of the play is recorded by Heywood, <i>Apology</i>, 45
(cf. App. C, No. lvii). The only direct evidence as to the date is Ben
Jonson’s statement in the Induction to <i>Bartholomew Fair</i> (1614),
‘He that will swear <i>Ieronimo</i> or <i>Andronicus</i> are the best
plays yet, shall pass unexcepted at here as a man whose judgment shows
it is constant, and hath stood still these five and twenty or thirty
years’. This yields 1584–9. Boas, xxx, argues for 1585–7; W. Bang in
<i>Englische Studien</i>, xxviii. 229, for 1589. The grounds for a
decision are slight, but the latter date seems to me the more plausible
in the absence of any clear allusion to the play in Nashe’s (q.v.)
<i>Menaphon</i> epistle of that year.</p>

<p>Strange’s men revived <i>Jeronymo</i> on 14 March 1592 and played it
sixteen times between that date and 22 Jan. 1593. I agree with Greg
(<i>Henslowe</i>, ii. 150, 153) that by <i>Jeronymo</i> Henslowe
meant <i>The Spanish Tragedy</i>, and that the performances of it are
distinguishable from those which the company was concurrently giving of
a related piece called <i>Don Horatio</i> or ‘the comedy of Jeronimo’,
which is probably not to be identified with the extant anonymous
<i>1 Jeronimo</i> (q.v.). On 7 Jan. 1597 the play was revived by the
Admiral’s and given twelve times between that date and 19 July. Another
performance, jointly with Pembroke’s, took place on 11 Oct. Finally, on
25 Sept. 1601 and 22 June 1602, Henslowe made payments to Jonson, on
behalf of the Admiral’s, for ‘adicyons’ to the play. At first sight, it
would seem natural to suppose that these ‘adicyons’ are the passages
(<span class="allsmcap">II.</span> v. 46–133; <span class="allsmcap">III.</span> ii. 65–129; <span class="allsmcap">III.</span> xii<sup>a</sup>.
1–157; <span class="allsmcap">IV.</span> iv. 168–217) which appear for the first time in
the print of 1602. But many critics have found it difficult to see
Jonson’s hand in these, notably Castelain, 886, who would assign them
to Webster. And as Henslowe marked the play as ‘n. e.’ in 1597, it is
probable that there was some substantial revision at that date. There
is a confirmation of this view in Jonson’s own mention of ‘the old
Hieronimo (as it was first acted)’ in the induction to <i>Cynthia’s
Revels</i> (1600). Perhaps the 1597 revival motived Jonson’s quotation
of the play by the mouth of Matheo in <i>E. M. I.</i> <span class="allsmcap">I.</span>
iv, and in <i>Satiromastix</i>, 1522, Dekker suggests that Jonson
himself ‘took’st mad Ieronimoes part, to get service among the
Mimickes’. Lines from the play are also recited by the page in
<i>Poetaster</i>, <span class="allsmcap">III.</span> iv. 231. In the Induction, 84, to
Marston’s <i>Malcontent</i> (1604) Condell explains the appropriation
of that play by the King’s from the Chapel with this retort, ‘Why not
Malevole in folio with us, as well as Jeronimo in decimo sexto with
them’. Perhaps <i>1 Jeronimo</i> is meant; in view of the stage history
of <i>The Spanish Tragedy</i>, as disclosed by Henslowe’s diary, the
King’s could hardly have laid claim to it.</p>

<p>The play was carried by English actors to Germany (Boas, xcix;

Ayrer is printed by Boas, 348, and with others in German and Dutch, in

<p>The existence of a play on Hamlet a decade or more before the end
of the sixteenth century is established by Henslowe’s note of its
revival by the Admiral’s and Chamberlain’s on 11 June 1594 (cf. Greg,
<i>Henslowe</i>, ii. 164), and some corroborative allusions, but its
relationship to Shakespeare’s play is wholly conjectural. The possible
coupling of ‘Kidde’ and ‘Hamlet’ in Nashe’s epistle to <i>Menaphon</i>
has led to many speculations as to Kyd’s authorship and as to the lines
on which the speculators think he would have treated the theme. Any
discussion of these is matter for an account of <i>Hamlet</i>.</p>

<p>[The accounts of Lee in <i>D. N. B.</i> and by Viscount Dillon in
<i>Bucks., Berks. and Oxon. Arch. Journ.</i>, xii (1906) 65, may be
supplemented from Aubrey, ii. 30, J. H. Lea, <i>Genealogical Notes

189, <i>The Lees of Quarrendon</i> (<i>Herald and Genealogist</i>, iii.
113, 289, 481), and <i>Genealogy of the Family of Lee</i> (1884).]</p>

<p>Lee belonged to a family claiming a Cheshire origin, which had long
been settled in Bucks. From 1441 they were constables and farmers of
Quarrendon in the same county, and the manor was granted by Henry
VIII to Sir Robert Lee, who was Gentleman Usher of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_399">[399]</span> Chamber and
afterwards Knight of the Body. His son Sir Anthony married Margaret,
sister of Sir Thomas Wyatt, the poet. Their son Henry was born in
1531, and Aubrey reports the scandal that he was ‘supposed brother
to Elizabeth’. He was page of honour to the King, and by 1550 Clerk
of the Armoury. He was knighted in 1553. By Sept. 1575 he was Master
of the Game at Woodstock (Dasent, ix. 23), and by 1577 Lieutenant of
the manor and park (Marshall, <i>Woodstock</i>, 160), holding ‘le
highe lodge’ and other royal houses in the locality. Probably he was
concerned with the foundation of Queen’s Day (cf. ch. i) in 1570,
which certainly originated near Oxford, and when the annual tilting on
this day at Whitehall was instituted, Lee acted as Knight of the Crown
until his retirement in 1590. He used as his favourite device a crowned
pillar. He took some part in the military enterprises of the reign,
and in 1578 became Master of the Armoury. In 1597 he was thought of as
Vice-Chamberlain, and on 23 April was installed as K.G. He was a great
sheep-farmer and encloser of land, and a great builder or enlarger of
houses, including Ditchley Hall, four or five miles from Woodstock, in
the parish of Spelsbury, where he died on 12 Feb. 1611. By his wife,
Anne, daughter of William Lord Paget, who died in 1590, he had two
sons and a daughter, who all predeceased him. His will of 6 Oct. 1609
provides for the erection of a tomb in Quarrendon Chapel near his own
for ‘M<sup>rs</sup>. Ann Vavasor alias Finch’. There are no tombs now, but the
inscriptions on Lee’s tomb and on a tablet in the chancel, also not
preserved, are recorded. The former says:</p>

  <div class="poetry-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div>‘In courtly justs his Soveraignes knight he was’,</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

<p class="p-left">and the latter adds:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="p-left">‘He shone in all those fayer partes that became his profession
and vowes, honoring his highly gracious Mistris with reysing
those later Olympiads of her Courte, justs and tournaments ...
wherein still himself lead and triumphed.’</p>
</div>

<p class="p-left">The writer is William Scott, who also, with Richard Lee,
witnessed the will. Anne Vavasour does not in fact appear to have been
buried at Quarrendon. Aubrey describes her as ‘his dearest deare’, and
says that her effigy was placed at the foot of his on the tomb, and
that the bishop threatened to have it removed. Anne’s tomb was in fact
defaced as early as 1611. Anne was daughter of Sir Henry and sister
of Sir Thomas Vavasour of Copmanthorpe, Yorks. She was a new maid of
honour who ‘flourished like the lily and the rose’ in 1590 (Lodge, ii.
423). Another Anne Vavasour came to Court as ‘newly of the beddchamber’
after being Lady Bedford’s ‘woman’, about July 1601 (Gawdy, 112,
conjecturally dated; cf. vol. iv, p. 67). Anne Clifford tells us that
‘my cousin Anne Vavisour’ was going with her mother Lady Cumberland and
Lady Warwick and herself to meet Queen Anne in 1603, and married Sir
Richard Warburton the same year (Wiffen, ii. 69, 72). The Queen is said
to have visited Sir Henry and his mistress at a lodge near Woodstock
called ‘Little Rest’, now ‘Lee’s Rest’, in 1608. After Lee’s death his
successor brought an action against Anne and her brother for illegal
detention of his effects (<i>5 N. Q.</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_400">[400]</span> iii. 294), and the feud was
still alive and Anne had added other sins to her score in 1618, when
Chamberlain wrote (Birch, ii. 86):</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘M^{rs}. Vavasour, old Sir Henry Lee’s woman, is like to be
called in question for having two husbands now alive. Young
Sir Henry Lee, the wild oats of Ireland, hath obtained the
confiscation of her, if he can prove it without touching her
life.’</p>
</div>

<p>Aubrey’s story that Lee’s nephew was disinherited in favour of ‘a
keeper’s sonne of Whitchwood-forest of his owne name, a one-eied young
man, no kinne to him’, is exaggerated gossip. Lee entailed his estate
on a second cousin.</p>

<p>I have brought together under Lee’s name two entertainments and
fragments of at least one other, which ought strictly to be classed
as anonymous, but with which he was certainly concerned, and to which
he may have contributed some of the ‘conceiptes, Himmes, Songes &amp;
Emblemes’, of which one of the fragments speaks.</p>



<p class="center p1"><i>The Woodstock Entertainment. Sept. 1575</i></p>

<p>[<i>MS.</i>] <i>Royal MS.</i> 18 A. xlviii (27). ‘The Tale of Hemetes
the Heremyte.’ [The tale is given in four languages, English, Latin,
Italian, and French. It is accompanied by pen-and-ink drawings, and
preceded by verses and an epistle to Elizabeth. The latter is dated
‘first of January, 1576’ and signed ‘G. Gascoigne’. The English text
is, with minor variations, that of the tale as printed in 1585. Its
authorship is not claimed by Gascoigne, who says that he has ‘turned
the eloquent tale of <i>Hemetes the Heremyte</i> (wherw<sup>th</sup> I saw yo<sup>r</sup>
lerned judgment greatly pleased at Woodstock) into latyne, Italyan and
frenche’, and contrasts his own ignorance with ‘thaucto<sup>rs</sup> skyll’.]</p>

<p><i>S. R.</i> 1579, Sept. 22. ‘A paradox provinge by Reason and Example
that Baldnes is muche better than bushie heare.’ <i>H. Denham</i>

<p>1579. A Paradoxe, Proving by reason and example, that Baldnesse is much
better than bushie haire.... Englished by Abraham Fleming. Hereunto is
annexed the pleasant tale of Hemetes the Heremite, pronounced before
the Queenes Majestie. Newly recognized both in Latine and Englishe, by
the said A. F. <i>H. Denham.</i> [Contains the English text of the Tale
and Gascoigne’s Latin version.]</p>

<p>1585. <i>Colophon</i>: ‘Imprinted at London for Thomas Cadman, 1585.’
[Originally contained a complete description of an entertainment,
of which the tale of Hemetes only formed part; but sig. A, with the
title-page, is missing. The unique copy, formerly in the Rowfant
library, is now in the B.M. The t.p. is a modern type-facsimile, based
on the head-line and colophon (McKerrow, <i>Bibl. Evidence</i>, 306).]</p>

<p><i>Editions</i> (<i>a</i>) from 1579, by J. Nichols, <i>Eliz.</i>
i. 553 (1823), and W. C. Hazlitt, <i>Gascoigne</i>, ii. 135 (1870);
(<i>b</i>) from <i>MS.</i> by J. W. Cunliffe, <i>Gascoigne</i>, ii. 473
(1910); (<i>c</i>) from 1585, by A. W. Pollard (1910, partly printed
1903) and J. W. Cunliffe (1911, <i>M. L. A.</i> xxvi. 92).</p>

<p>Gascoigne’s manuscript is chiefly of value as fixing the locality of
the entertainment, which is not mentioned in the mutilated print of
1585. The date can hardly be doubtful. Elizabeth spent considerable
periods at Woodstock in 1572, 1574, and 1575, but it so happens
that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_401">[401]</span> only in 1575 was she there on the 20th of a month (<i>vide
infra</i> and App. B). Moreover, Laurence Humphrey’s <i>Oratio</i>
delivered at Woodstock on 11 Sept. 1575 (Nichols, i. 590) refers
to the entertainment in the phrase ‘an ... Gandina spectacula ...
dabit’. The description takes the form of a letter from an eyewitness,
evidently not the deviser, and professing ignorance of Italian; not,
therefore, Gascoigne, as pointed out by Mr. Pollard. At the beginning
of sig. B, Hemetes, a hermit, has evidently just interrupted a fight
between Loricus and Contarenus. He brings them, with the Lady Caudina,
to a bower, where Elizabeth is placed, and tells his Tale, of which
the writer says, ‘hee shewed a great proofe of his audacity, in
which tale if you marke the woords with this present world, or were
acquainted with the state of the deuises, you should finde no lesse
hidden then vttered, and no lesse vttered then shoulde deserue a
double reading ouer, euen of those (with whom I finde you a companion)
that haue disposed their houres to the study of great matters’. The
Tale explains how the personages have come together. Contarenus loved
Caudina, daughter of Occanon Duke of Cambia. At Occanon’s request,
an enchantress bore him away, and put him in charge of the blind
hermit, until after seven years he should fight the hardiest knight
and see the worthiest lady in the world. Caudina, setting out with
two damsels to seek him, met at the grate of Sibilla with Loricus, a
knight seeking renown as a means to his mistress’s favour. Sibilla
bade them wander, till they found a land in all things best, and with
a Princess most worthy. Hemetes himself has been blinded by Venus for
loving books as well as a lady, and promised by Apollo the recovery
of his sight, where most valiant knights fight, most constant lovers
meet, and the worthiest lady looks on. Obviously it is all a compliment
to the worthiest lady. Thus the Tale ends. The Queen is now led to
the hermit’s abode, an elaborate sylvan banqueting-house, built on
a mound forty feet high, roofed by an oak, and hung with pictures
and posies of ‘the noble or men of great credite’, some of which
the French ambassador made great suit to have. Here Elizabeth was
visited by ‘the Queen of the Fayry drawen with 6 children in a waggon
of state’, who presented her with an embroidered gown. Couplets or
‘posies’ set in garlands were also given to the Queen, to the Ladies
Derby, Warwick, Hunsdon, Howard, Susan and Mary Vere, and to Mistresses
Skidmore, Parry, Abbington, Sidney, Hopton, Katherine Howard, Garret,
Bridges, Burrough, Knowles, and Frances Howard. After a speech from
Caudina, Elizabeth departed, as it was now dark, well pleased with her
afternoon, and listening to a song from an oak tree as she went by.
A somewhat cryptic passage follows. Elizabeth is said to have left
‘earnest command that the whole in order as it fell, should be brought
her in writing, which being done, as I heare, she vsed, besides her
owne skill, the helpe of the deuisors, &amp; how thinges were made I know
not, but sure I am her Maiesty hath often in speech some part hereof
with mirth at the remembrance.’ Then follows a comedy acted on ‘the 20
day of the same moneth’, which ‘was as well thought of, as anye thing
ever done before her Maiestie, not onely of her, but of the rest:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_402">[402]</span> in
such sort that her Graces passions and other the Ladies could not [?
but] shew it selfe in open place more than euer hath beene seene’. The
comedy, in 991 lines of verse, is in fact a sequel to the Tale. In it
Occanon comes to seek Caudina, who is persuaded by his arguments and
the mediation of Eambia, the Fairy Queen, to give up her lover for her
country’s sake.</p>

<p>Pollard suggests Gascoigne as the author of the comedy, but of this
there is no external evidence. He also regards the intention of the
whole entertainment as being the advancement of Leicester’s suit.
Leicester was no doubt at Woodstock, even before the Queen, for he
wrote her a letter from there on 4 Sept. (<i>S. P. D. Eliz</i>. cv.
36); but the undated letter which Pollard cites (cv. 38), and in which
Leicester describes himself as ‘in his survey to prepare for her
coming’, probably precedes the Kenilworth visit. Pollard dates it 6
Sept., but Elizabeth herself seems to have reached Woodstock by that
date. Professor Cunliffe, on the other hand, thinks that the intention
was unfavourable to Leicester’s suit, and thus explains the stress
laid on Caudina’s renunciation of her lover for political reasons. I
doubt if there is any reference to the matter at all; it would have
been dangerous matter for a courtly pen. Doubtless the writer of the
description talks of ‘audacity’, in the Tale, not the comedy. But has
he anything more in mind than Sir Henry Lee, whom we are bound to find,
here as elsewhere, in Loricus, and his purely conventional worship of
Elizabeth?</p>



<p class="center p1"><i>The Tilt Yard Entertainment. 17 Nov. 1590</i></p>

<p>There are two contemporary descriptions, viz.:</p>

<p>1590. Polyhymnia Describing, the Honourable Triumph at Tylt, before her
Maiestie, on the 17 of Nouember last past, being the first day of the
three and thirtith yeare of her Highnesse raigne. With Sir Henrie Lea,
his resignation of honour at Tylt, to her Maiestie, and receiued by the
right honorable, the Earle of Cumberland. <i>R. Jones.</i> [Dedication
by George Peele to Lord Compton on verso of t.p.]</p>

<p>1602. W. Segar, Honor, Military and Ciuill, Book iii, ch. 54, ‘The
Originall occasions of the yeerely Triumphs in England’.</p>

<p>Segar’s account is reproduced by Nichols, <i>Eliz.</i> iii. 41, and
both in the editions of Peele (q.v.) by Dyce and Bullen. A manuscript
copy with variants from the Q. is at St. John’s College, Oxford (F. S.
Boas in <i>M. L. R.</i> xi. 300). <i>Polyhymnia</i> mainly consists
of a blank verse description and eulogy of the twenty-six tilters, in
couples according to the order of the first running of six courses
each, viz. Sir Henry Lee and the Earl of Cumberland, Lord Strange and
Thomas Gerrard, Lord Compton and Henry Nowell, Lord Burke and Sir
Edward Denny, the Earl of Essex and Fulk Greville, Sir Charles Blount
and Thomas Vavasor, Robert Carey and William Gresham, Sir William
Knowles and Anthony Cooke, Sir Thomas Knowles and Sir Philip Butler,
Robert Knowles and Ralph Bowes, Thomas Sidney and Robert Alexander,
John Nedham and Richard Acton, Charles Danvers and Everard Digby. The
colours and in some cases the ‘device’ or ‘show’ are indicated. Lee is
described as</p>

<p class="p-left">The three Knowles brothers bore golden boughs. A final section of the
poem describes how, after the running, Sir Henry Lee, ‘knight of the
Crown’, unarmed himself in a pavilion of Vesta, and petitioned the
Queen to allow him to yield his ‘honourable place’ to Cumberland, to
whom he gave his armour and lance, vowing to betake himself to orisons.</p>

<p>Segar gives a fuller account of Lee’s fantasy. He had vowed, ‘in the
beginning of her happy reigne’, to present himself yearly in arms
on the day of Elizabeth’s accession. The courtiers, incited by his
example, had yearly assembled, ‘not vnlike to the antient Knighthood
della Banda in Spaine’, but in 1590, ‘being now by age ouertaken’,
Lee resigned his office to Cumberland. The ceremony took place ‘at
the foot of the staires vnder her gallery-window in the Tilt-yard at
Westminster’, where Elizabeth sat with the French ambassador, Viscount
Turenne. A pavilion, representing the Temple of the Vestal Virgins,
arose out of the earth. Within was an altar, with gifts for the queen;
before the door a crowned pillar, embraced by an eglantine, and bearing
a complimentary inscription. As the knights approached, ‘M. Hales her
maiesties seruant’ sang verses beginning:</p>

  <div class="poetry-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div>My golden locks time hath to siluer turned.</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

<p>The vestals then gave the Queen a veil and a cloak and safeguard,
the buttons of which bore the ‘emprezes’ or ‘badges’ of many nobles,
friends of Lee, each fixed to an embroidered pillar, the last being
‘like the character of <i>&amp;c.</i>’ Finally Lee doffed his armour,
presented Cumberland, armed and horsed him, and himself donned a
side-coat of black velvet and a buttoned cap of the country fashion.
‘After all these ceremonies, for diuers dayes hee ware vpon his cloake
a crowne embrodered, with a certaine motto or deuice, but what his
intention therein was, himselfe best knoweth.’</p>

<p>The Queen appointed Lee to appear yearly at the exercises, ‘to see,
suruey, and as one most carefull and skilfull to direct them’. Segar
dwells on Lee’s virtues and valour, and concludes by stating that the
annual actions had been performed by 1 Duke, 19 Earls, 27 Barons, 4
Knights of the Garter, and above 150 other Knights and Esquires.</p>

<p>On 20 Nov. 1590 Richard Brakinbury wrote to Lord Talbot (Lodge,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_404">[404]</span>
ii. 419): ‘These sports were great, and done in costly sort, to her
Majesty’s liking, and their great cost. To express every part, with
sundry devices, is more fit for them that delight in them, than for me,
who esteemeth little such vanities, I thank God.’</p>

<p>P. A. Daniel (<i>Athenaeum</i> for 8 Feb. 1890) notes that a suit
of armour in Lord Hothfield’s collection, which once belonged to
Cumberland and is represented in certain portraits of him, is probably
the identical suit given him by Lee, as it bears a monogram of Lee’s
name.</p>

<p>There has been some controversy about the authorship of the verses sung
by ‘M. Hales’, who was Robert Hales, a lutenist. They appear, headed
‘A Sonnet’, and unsigned, on a page at the end of <i>Polyhymnia</i>,
and have therefore been ascribed to Peele. The evidence, though
inconclusive, is better than the wanton conjecture which led Mr. Bond
to transfer them to Lyly (<i>Works</i>, i. 410). But a different
version in <i>Rawl. Poet. MS.</i> 148, f. 19, is subscribed ‘q<sup>d</sup> S<sup>r</sup>
Henry Leigh’, and some resemblances of expression are to be found in
other verses assigned to Lee in R. Dowland, <i>Musicall Banquet</i>
(1610), No. 8 (Bond, i. 517; Fellowes, 459). It is not impossible
that Lee himself may have been the author. One of the pieces in the
<i>Ferrers MS.</i> (<i>vide</i> p. 406 <i>infra</i>) refers to his
‘himmes &amp; songes’. If the verses, which also appear anonymously in J.
Dowland, <i>First Booke of Songs or Ayres</i> (1597, Fellowes, 418),
are really Lee’s, Wyatt’s nephew was no contemptible poet. Finally,
there are echoes of the same theme in yet another set of anonymous
verses in J. Dowland, <i>Second Book of Airs</i> (1600, Fellowes, 422),
which are evidently addressed to Lee.</p>

<p>The Ferrers MS. seems to contain ten distinct pieces, separated from
each other only by headings, to which I have prefixed the numbers.</p>

<p class="p-left ph">(i) ‘A Cartell for a Challeng.’</p>

<p class="p0">Three ‘strange forsaken knightes’ offer to maintain ‘that Loue is worse
than hate, his Subiectes worse than slaues, and his Rewarde worse than
naught: And that there is a Ladie that scornes Loue and his power, of
more vertue and greater bewtie than all the Amorouse Dames that be
at this day in the worlde’. This cannot be dated.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_405">[405]</span> Sir Robert Carey
(<i>Memoirs</i>, 33) tilted as a ‘forsaken knight’ on 17 Nov. 1593 (not
1592, as stated by Brotanek, 60), but he was not a challenger, and was
alone. The tone resembles that of Sir Henry Lee, and if he took part,
the date must be earlier than 1590.</p>

<p class="p-left ph">(ii) ‘Sir Henry Lee’s challenge before the Shampanie.’</p>

<p class="p0">A ‘strange knight that warres against hope and fortune’ will maintain
the cause of Despair in a green suit.</p>

<p>Hamper explained ‘Shampanie’ as ‘the lists or field of contention,
from the French <i>campagne</i>’; but Segar, <i>Honor, Military and
Ciuill</i>, 197, records, from an intercepted letter of ‘Monsieur
de Champany ... being ambassador in England for causes of the Low
Countreys’, an occasion on which Sir Henry Lee, ‘the most accomplished
cavaliero I had euer seene’, broke lances with other gentlemen in his
honour at Greenwich. M. de Champagny was an agent of the native Flemish
Catholics, and visited England in 1575 and 1585 (Froude, x. 360; xii.
39). As his letter named ‘Sir’ C. Hatton, who was knighted in 1578,
the visit of 1585 must be in question. The Court was at Greenwich from
March to July of that year.</p>

<p class="p-left ph">(iii) ‘The Supplication of the Owld Knight.’</p>

<p class="p0">A speech to the ‘serveres of this English Holiday, or rather Englandes
Happie Daye’, in which a knight disabled by age, ‘yet once (thowe
unwoorthie) your fellowe in armes, and first celebrator, in this kinde,
of this sacred memorie of that blessed reigne’, begs them to ‘accepte
to your fellowshippe this oneley sonne of mine’.</p>

<p>This is evidently a speech by Lee, on some 17 Nov. later than 1590.
Lee’s own sons died in childhood; probably the ‘son’ introduced was a
relative, but possibly only a ‘son’ in chivalry.</p>

<p class="p-left ph">(iv) ‘The Message of the Damsell of the Queene of Fayries.’</p>

<p class="p0">An ‘inchanted knight’ sends the Queen an image of Cupid. She is
reminded how ‘at the celebrating the joyfull remembraunce of the most
happie daye of your Highnes entrance into Gouerment of this most
noble Islande, howe manie knightes determined, not far hence, with
boulde hartes and broken launces, to paye there vowes and shewe theire
prowes’. The ‘inchanted knight’ could not ‘chardge staffe, nor strike
blowe’, but entered the jousts, and bore the blows of others.</p>

<p>If this has reference to the first celebration of 17 Nov., it may
be of near date to the Woodstock Entertainment of 1575 in which the
fairy queen appeared. The knight, ‘full hardie and full haples’, is
enchanted, but is not said to be old.</p>

<p class="p-left ph">(v) ‘The Olde Knightes Tale.’</p>

<p class="p0">‘Not far from hence, nor verie long agoe,’ clearly in 1575, ‘the fayrie
Queene the fayrest Queene saluted’, and the pleasures included ‘justes
and feates of armed knightes’, and ‘enchaunted pictures’ in a bower.
The knight was bidden by the fairy queen to guard the pictures and keep
his eyes on the crowned pillar. He became ‘a stranger ladies thrall’,
neglected this duty, and was cast into a deadly sleep. Now he is freed,
apparently through the intervention of Elizabeth, to whom the verses
are addressed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_406">[406]</span></p>

<p class="p-left ph">(vi) ‘The Songe after Dinner at the two Ladies entrance.’</p>

<p class="p0">Celebrates the setting free by a prince’s grace, of captive knights and
ladies, and bids farewell to inconstancy.</p>

<p class="p-left ph">(vii) ‘The Ladies Thankesgeuing for theire Deliuerie from
Unconstancie.’</p>

<p class="p0">A speech to the Queen, in the same vein as (vi), followed by a dialogue
between Li[berty], or Inconstancy, and Constancy. This is datable in
1592 from another copy printed in <i>The Phoenix Nest</i> (1593), with
the title ‘An Excellent Dialogue betweene Constancie and Inconstancie:
as it was by speech presented to her maiestie, in the last Progresse
at Sir Henrie Leighes house’. Yet another copy, in <i>Inner Temple
Petyt MS.</i> 538, 43, f. 299. ‘A Dialogue betweene Constancie and
Inconstancie spoken before the Queenes Majestie at Woodstock’ is
ascribed to ‘Doctor Edes’.</p>

<p class="p-left ph">(viii) ‘The last Songe.’</p>

<p class="p0">A rejoicing on the coming of Eliza, with references to constancy and
inconstancy, the aged knight, and the pillar and crown.</p>

<p class="p-left ph">(ix) ‘The second daies woorke where the Chaplayne maketh this
Relation.’</p>

<p>An Oration to the Queen by the chaplain of Loricus, ‘an owlde Knight,
now a newe religiouse Hermite’. The story of Loricus was once told [in
1575] ‘by a good father of his owne coate, not farr from this coppies’.
Once he ‘rann the restles race of desire.... Sometymes he consorted
with couragious gentelmen, manifesting inward joyes by open justes, the
yearly tribute of his dearest Loue. Somtimes he summoned the witnesse
of depest conceiptes, Himmes &amp; Songes &amp; Emblemes, dedicating them to
the honor of his heauenlye mistres’. Retiring, through envy and age,
to the country, he found the speaker at a homely cell, made him his
chaplain, and built for their lodging and that of a page ‘the Crowne
Oratory’, with a ‘Piller of perpetual remembraunce’ as his device
on the entrance. Here he lies, at point of death, and has addressed
his last testament to the Queen. This is in verse, signed ‘Loricus,
columnae coronatae custos fidelissimus’, and witnessed by ‘Stellatus,
rectoriae coronatae capellanus’, and ‘Renatus, equitis coronatae servus
obseruantissimus’.</p>

<p class="p-left ph">(x) ‘The Page bringeth tydings of his Maister’s Recouerie &amp;
presenteth his Legacie.’</p>

<p class="p0">A further address to the Queen, with a legacy in verse of the whole
Mannor of Loue, signed by Loricus and witnessed by Stellatus and
Renatus.</p>

<p>This exhausts the <i>Ferrers MS.</i>, but I can add from the <i>Petyt
MS.</i> f. 300<sup>v</sup>&mdash;</p>

<p class="p-left ph">(xi) ‘The melancholie Knights complaint in the wood.’</p>

<p class="p0">This, like (vii), is ascribed in the MS. to ‘Doctor Edes’. It consists
of 35 lines in 6 stanzas of 6 lines each (with one line missing) and
begins:</p>

  <div class="poetry-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div>What troupes are theis, which ill aduised, presse</div>
        <div>Into this more than most vnhappie place.</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_407">[407]</span></p>

<p>Allusions to the freeing of enchanted knights and ladies and to
constancy and inconstancy connect it closely with (vi)-(viii).</p>

<p>Obviously most of these documents, and therefore probably all, belong
to devices presented by Sir Henry Lee. But they are of different dates,
and not demonstrably in chronological order. A single occasion accounts
for (vi)-(viii) and (xi), and a single occasion, which the mention of
‘the second daie’ suggests may have been the same, for (ix) and (x);
and probably Mr. Bond is justified in regarding all these as forming
part with (vii) of the entertainment at Lee’s house in the progress of
1592. But I do not see his justification for attaching (iv) and (v) to
them, and I think that these are probably fragments of the Woodstock
Entertainment of 1575, or not far removed from that in time. Nor has
he any evidence for locating the entertainment of 1592 at Quarrendon,
which was only one of several houses belonging to Sir Henry Lee, and
could not be meant by the ‘coppies’ near Woodstock of (ix). It was
doubtless, as the Petyt MS. version of (vii) tells us, at Woodstock,
either at one of Lee’s lodges, or at Ditchley, during the royal visit
to Woodstock of 18–23 Sept. 1592. I learn from Viscount Dillon that
a MS. of part of this entertainment, dated 20 Sept., is still at
Ditchley. Finally, Bond’s attribution of all the pieces (i)-(x) to Lyly
is merely guesswork. Hamper assigned them to George Ferrers, probably
because the owner of his MS. was a Ferrers. George Ferrers did in fact
help in the Kenilworth Entertainment of 1575, and might therefore
have helped in that at Woodstock; but he died in 1579, too early for
(vi)-(xi). No doubt (vii) and (xi) are by Richard Edes (q.v.). He may
have written the whole of this Woodstock Entertainment. On the other
hand, a phrase in (ix) suggests that Lee may have penned some of his
own conceits. Brotanek, 62, suggests that the two ladies of (vi) are
Lee’s wife and his mistress Anne Vavasour, and that Elizabeth came
to Lee’s irregular household to set it in order. This hardly needs
refuting, but in fact Lee’s wife died in 1590 and his connexion with
Anne Vavasour was probably of later date.</p>


<p class="p-left p2">ROBERT LEE.</p>

<p>For his career as an actor, see ch. xv.</p>

<p>He may have been, but was not necessarily, the author of <i>The
Miller</i> which the Admiral’s bought from him for £1 on 22 Feb. 1598
(Greg, <i>Henslowe</i>, ii. 191).</p>


<p class="p-left p2">THOMAS LEGGE (1535–1607).</p>

<p>Of Norwich origin, Legge entered Corpus Christi, Cambridge, in 1552,
and took his B.A. in 1557, his M.A. in 1560, and his LL.D. in 1575.
After migration to Trinity and Jesus, he had become Master of Caius
in 1573. In 1593 he was Vice-Chancellor, and in that capacity took
part in the negotiations of the University with the Privy Council for
a restraint of common plays in Cambridge (<i>M. S. C.</i> i. 200).
His own reputation as a dramatist is acknowledged by Meres, who in
1598 placed him among ‘our best for Tragedie’, and added that, ‘as M.
Anneus Lucanus writ two excellent Tragedies, one called <i>Medea</i>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_408">[408]</span>
the other <i>de Incendio Troiae cum Priami calamitate</i>: so Doctor
<i>Leg</i> hath penned two famous tragedies, y<sup>e</sup> one of <i>Richard the

<p>The names in the actor-lists, which agree, confirm those MSS. which
date a production in March 1580 (Boas, 394), and as Essex left
Cambridge in 1581, the date in the <i>Tanner MS.</i>, in so far as it
relates to a performance before him, is probably an error. It does
not seem so clear to me that the <i>Caius MS.</i> may not point to an
earlier production in 1573. And it is quite possible that there may
have been revivals in some or all of the later years named in the MSS.
The reputation of the play is indicated, not only by the notice of it
by Meres (<i>vide supra</i>), but also by allusions in Harington’s
<i>Apologie of Poetrie</i> (1591); cf. App. C, No. xlv. and Nashe’s
<i>Have With You to Saffron Walden</i> (1596, <i>Works</i>, iii.
13). It may even, directly or indirectly, have influenced <i>Richard
III</i>. The argument to the first <i>Actio</i> is headed ‘Chapman,
Argumentum primae actionis’, but it seems difficult to connect George
Chapman with the play.</p>



<p class="center p1"><i>Lost Play</i></p>

<p class="center p1"><i>The Destruction of Jerusalem</i></p>

<p>Meres calls this tragedy ‘famous’. Fuller, <i>Worthies</i> (1662), ii.
156, says that ‘Having at last refined it to the purity of the publique
standard, some Plageary filched it from him, just as it was to be
acted’. Apparently it was in English and was printed, as it appears<span class="pagenum" id="Page_409">[409]</span>
in the lists of Archer and Kirkman (Greg, <i>Masques</i>, lxii). It
can hardly have been the <i>Jerusalem</i> revived by Strange’s in 1592
(Greg, <i>Henslowe</i>, ii. 155). Can any light be thrown on Fuller’s
story by the fact that in 1584 a ‘new Play of the Destruction of
Jerusalem’ was adopted by the city of Coventry as a craft play in place
of the old Corpus Christi cycle, and a sum of £13 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>
paid to John Smythe of St. John’s, Oxford, ‘for hys paynes for
writing of the tragedye’ (<i>Mediaeval Stage</i>, ii. 361; H. Craig,
<i>Coventry Corpus Christi Plays</i> (<i>E. E. T. S.</i>), 90, 92, 93,
102, 103, 109)?</p>


<p class="p-left p2">THOMAS LODGE (<i>c.</i> 1557–1625).</p>

<p>Lodge, who uses the description ‘gentleman’, was son of Sir Thomas
Lodge, a Lord Mayor of London. His elder brother, William, married
Mary, daughter of Thomas Blagrave, Clerk of the Revels (cf. ch. iii).
He entered Merchant Taylors in 1571, Trinity College, Oxford, in 1573,
whence he took his B.A. in 1577, and Lincoln’s Inn in 1578. In 1579
(cf. App. C, No. xxiii) he plunged into controversy with a defence of
the stage in reply to Stephen Gosson’s <i>Schoole of Abuse</i>. Gosson
speaks slightingly of his opponent as ‘hunted by the heavy hand of
God, and become little better than a vagrant, looser than liberty,
lighter than vanity itself’, and although Lodge took occasion to defend
his moral character from aspersion, it is upon record that he was
called before the Privy Council ‘to aunswere certen maters to be by
them objected against him’, and was ordered on 27 June 1581 to give
continued attendance (Dasent, xiii. 110). By 1583 he had married. His
literary work largely took the form of romances in the manner of Lyly
and Greene. <i>Rosalynde: Euphues’ Golden Legacy</i>, published (S. R.
6 Oct. 1590) on his return from a voyage to Terceras and the Canaries
with Captain Clarke, is typical and was Shakespeare’s source for <i>As
You Like It</i>. His acknowledged connexion with the stage is slight;
and the attempt of Fleay, ii. 43, to assign to him a considerable
share in the anonymous play-writing of his time must be received with
caution, although he was still controverting Gosson in 1583 (cf. App.
C, No. xxxv), and too much importance need not be attached to his
intention expressed in <i>Scylla’s Metamorphosis</i> (S. R. 22 Sept.
1589):</p>

<p class="p-left">He is less likely than Nashe to be the ‘young Juvenal,
that biting satirist, that lastly with me together writ a Comedy’ of
Greene’s <i>Groats-worth of Wit</i> epistle in 1592 (cf. App. C, No.
xlviii). I should not cavil at the loose description of <i>A Looking
Glass for London and England</i> as a comedy; but ‘biting satirist’
hardly suits Lodge; and at the time of Greene’s last illness he was out
of England on an expedition led by Thomas Cavendish to South America
and the Pacific, which started on 26 Aug. 1591 and returned on 11 June
1593. After his return Lodge essayed lyric in <i>Phillis</i> (1593)
and satire in <i>A Fig for Momus</i> (1595); but he cannot be shown
to have resumed writing for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_410">[410]</span> the stage, although the Dulwich records
make it clear that he had relations with Henslowe, who had in Jan.
1598 to satisfy the claims which Richard Topping, a tailor, had made
against him before three successive Lord Chamberlains, as Lodge’s
security for a long-standing debt (Greg, <i>Henslowe Papers</i>, 44,
172). Lodge himself was then once more beyond the seas. One of the
documents was printed by Collier, <i>Memoirs of Alleyn</i>, 45, with
forged interpolations intended to represent Lodge as an actor, for
which there is no other evidence. Subsequently Lodge took a medical
degree at Avignon, was incorporated at Oxford in 1602, and obtained
some reputation as a physician. He also became a Catholic, and had
again to leave the country for recusancy, but was allowed to return
in Jan. 1610 (cf. F. P. Wilson in <i>M. L. R.</i> ix. 99). About
1619 he was engaged in legal proceedings with Alleyn, and for a time
practised in the Low Countries, returning to London before his death in
1625. Small, 50, refutes the attempts of Fleay, i. 363, and Penniman,
<i>War</i>, 55, 85, to identify him with Fungoso in <i>E. M. O.</i> and
Asotus in <i>Cynthia’s Revels</i>. Fleay, ii. 158, 352, adds Churms and
Philomusus in the anonymous <i>Wily Beguiled</i> and <i>Return from

<p>Several miscellaneous works by Lupton appeared during 1572–84. He may
be the ‘Mr. Lupton’ whom the Corporation of Worcester paid during the
progress of 1575 (Nichols, i. 549) ‘for his paynes for and in devising

<p>A final prayer for the Queen who ‘hath begon godly’ suggests an
earlier date than that of Lupton’s other recorded work. Fleay, ii. 56,
would identify the play with <i>The Devil and Dives</i> named in the
anonymous <i>Histriomastix</i>, but Dives only appears once, and not
with Satan.</p>


<p class="p-left p2">JOHN LYLY (1554?-1606).</p>

<p>Lyly was of a gentle Hampshire family, the grandson of William, high
master of St. Paul’s grammar school, and son of Peter, a diocesan
official at Canterbury, where he was probably born some seventeen years
before 8 Oct. 1571, when he matriculated from Magdalen College, Oxford.
He took his B.A. in 1573 and his M.A. in 1575, after a vain attempt
in 1574 to secure a fellowship through the influence of Burghley. He
went to London and dwelt in the Savoy. By 1578, when he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_412">[412]</span> published
<i>Euphues</i>, <i>The Anatomy of Wit</i>, he was apparently in the
service of Lord Delawarr, and by 1580 in that of Burghley’s son-in-law,
Edward, Earl of Oxford. It is a pleasing conjecture that he may have
been the author of ‘the two prose books played at the Belsavage, where
you shall find never a word without wit, never a line without pith,
never a letter placed in vain’, thus praised in <i>The Schoole of
Abuse</i> (1579) of his fellow euphuist, Stephen Gosson. He incurred
the enmity of Gabriel Harvey by suggesting to Oxford that he was aimed
at in the <i>Speculum Tuscanismi</i> of Harvey’s <i>Three Letters</i>
(1580). In 1582 he had himself incurred Oxford’s displeasure, but
the trouble was surmounted, and about 1584 he held leases in the
Blackfriars (cf. ch. xvii), one at least of which he obtained through
Oxford, for the purposes of a theatrical speculation, in the course
of which he took to Court a company which bore Oxford’s name, but
was probably made up of boys from the Chapel and St. Paul’s choirs.
Presumably the speculation failed, for in June 1584 Lyly, who on 22
Nov. 1583 had married Beatrice Browne of Mexborough, Yorks., was in
prison for debt, whence he was probably relieved by a gift from Oxford,
in reward for his service, of a rent-charge which he sold for £250.
His connexion with the stage was not, however, over, for he continued
to write for the Paul’s boys until they stopped playing about 1591.
Harvey calls Lyly the ‘Vicemaster of Paules and the Foolemaster of the
Theatre’. From this it has been inferred that he held an ushership at
the Paul’s choir school. But ‘vice’ is a common synonym for ‘fool’ and
‘vicemaster’, like ‘foolemaster’, probably only means ‘playwright’.
Nothing written by Lyly for the Theater in particular or for any
adult stage is known to exist, but he seems to have taken part with
Nashe in the retorts of orthodoxy during 1589 and 1590 to the Martin
Marprelate pamphleteers, probably writing the tract called <i>Pappe
with a Hatchett</i> (1589), and he may have been responsible for some
of the plays which certainly formed an element in that retort. Lyly’s
ambitions were in the direction of courtly rather than of academic
preferment. He seems to have had some promise of favour from Elizabeth
about 1585 and to have been more definitely ‘entertained her servant’
as Esquire of the Body, probably ‘extraordinary’, in or about 1588,
with a hint to ‘aim his courses at the Revels’, doubtless at the
reversion of the Mastership, then held by Edmund Tilney. Mr. R. W. Bond
bases many conjectures about Lyly’s career on a theory that he actually
held the post of Clerk Comptroller in the Revels Office, but the known
history of the post (cf. ch. iii) makes this impossible. From 1596 he
is found living in the parish of St. Bartholomew the Less. He seems
to have ceased writing plays for some while in 1590, and may be the
‘pleasant Willy’ spoken of as ‘dead of late’ and sitting ‘in idle Cell’
in Spenser’s <i>Tears of the Muses</i> (1591), although it is possible
that Tarlton (q.v.) is intended. But <i>The Woman in the Moon</i> at
least is of later date, and it is possible that both the Chapel and the
Paul’s boys were again acting his old plays by the end of the century.
In 1595 he was lamenting the overthrow of his fortunes, and by about
1597 the reversion of the Mastership of the Revels had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_413">[413]</span> been definitely
promised to George Buck. There exist several letters written by Lyly
to the Queen and to Sir Robert Cecil between 1597 and 1601, in which
he complains bitterly of the wrong done him. Later letters of 1603
and 1605 suggest that at last he had obtained his reward, possibly
something out of the Essex forfeitures for which he was asking in 1601.
In any case, he did not live to enjoy it long, as the register of St.
Bartholomew’s the Less records his burial on 30 Nov. 1606.</p>

<p>The order of the 1584 prints is not quite clear; (<i>c</i>) follows
(<i>b</i>), but the absence of any collation of (<i>a</i>) leaves its
place conjectural. I conjecture that it came first, partly because a
correction in the date of Court performance is more likely to have been
made after one inaccurate issue than after two, partly because its
abandoned t.p. title serves as running title in all three issues. I do
not think the reversion to ‘twelfe day’ in 1591, when the facts may
have been forgotten, carries much weight. If so, the Court production
was on a 1 Jan., and although the wording of the t.p. suggests,
rather than proves, that it was 1 Jan. in the year of publication,
this date fits in with the known facts of Lyly’s connexion with the
Blackfriars (cf. ch. xvii). The <i>Chamber Accounts</i> (App. B) give
the performers on this day as Lord Oxford’s servants, but I take this
company to have been a combination of Chapel and Paul’s children (cf.
chh. xii, xiii). Fleay, ii. 39, and Bond, ii. 310, with imperfect
lists of Court performances before them, suggest 31 Dec. 1581, taking
‘newyeares day at night’, rather lamely, for New Year’s Eve. So does
Feuillerat, 574, but I am not sure that his view will have survived
his Blackfriars investigations. In any case, the play must have been
written later than Jan. 1580, as Lyly uses Sir T. North’s English
translation of Plutarch, of which the preface is dated in that month.
In a prefatory note by N. W. to S. Daniel, <i>The Worthy Tract of
Paulus Jovius</i> (1585), that work is commended above ‘Tarlton’s toys

<p>I date the Court production on the Shrove-Tuesday before the S. R.

<p>The only performance by Paul’s, on a 1 Jan. at Greenwich, which

in <span class="allsmcap">III.</span> iii. 41 is an allusion to the approaching year

425, prefers 1586 or 1587, regardless of the fact that the New Year
plays in these years were by the Queen’s men. A phrase in <span class="allsmcap">V.</span>
iii. 86 proves it later than <i>Sapho and Phao</i>. But if, as seems
probable, the 1585 entry in the Stationers’ Register was of this play,
the original production must have been at least as early as 1584–5, and
that of 1588 a revival.</p>

<p>The prologue and epilogue were evidently for the Court. The epistle
describes this as the first of certain comedies which had come into
the printer’s hands ‘since the plays in Pauls were dissolved’. Baker,
lxxxiii, suggested a date of composition in the autumn of 1579, while
Spingarn, Bond, iii. 11, and Feuillerat, 577, take the Candlemas of the
t.p. to be that of 1586, but the only available Candlemas performance
by the Paul’s boys is that of 1588 (cf. App. B). With Long I find no
conviction in the attempts of Halpin, Baker, Bond, and Feuillerat to
trace Elizabeth’s politics and amours in the play. If Lyly had meant
half of what they suggest, he would have ruined his career in her
service at the outset.</p>

<p>Internal allusions suggest a date as late as 1589, and the Twelfth

Bond, iii. 111, accept this date. Feuillerat, 578, prefers 6 Jan. 1589,
because Gabriel Harvey alludes to the play in his <i>Advertisement to
Pap-Hatchet</i>, dated 5 Nov. 1589. But there was no Court performance
on that day, and Harvey may have seen the play ‘in Paules’.</p>

<p>F. Brie (<i>E. S.</i> xlii. 222) suggests that the play borrowed from
Greene’s <i>Greenes Metamorphosis</i> (S. R. 9 Dec. 1588). Probably the

        <div>But not the last, unless the first displease.</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

<p class="p-left">This has been taken as indicating that the play was
Lyly’s first; but it need only mean that it was his first in verse.
All the others are in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_417">[417]</span> prose. The blank verse is that of the nineties,
rather than that of the early eighties. There is nothing to show who
were the actors, but it is not unlikely that, after the plays in Paul’s
were dissolved, Lyly tried his hand in a new manner for a new company.
Feuillerat, 232, 580, suggests that Elizabeth may have taken the satire
of women amiss and that the ‘overthwartes’ of Lyly’s fortunes of which
he complained in Jan. 1595 may have been the result. He puts the date,
therefore, in 1593–4.</p>



<p class="center p1"><i>Doubtful Work</i></p>

<p>Lyly has been suggested as the author of <i>Maid’s Metamorphosis</i>
and <i>A Warning for Fair Women</i> (cf. ch. xxiv) and of several
anonymous entertainments and fragments of entertainments (ibid., and
<i>supra</i>, s.vv. Cecil, Clifford, Lee).</p>


<p class="p-left p2">LEWIS MACHIN (<i>fl. c.</i> 1608).</p>

<p>Nothing is known of Machin’s personality. He is probably the L. M.
who contributed ‘eglogs’ to the <i>Mirrha</i> (1607) of the King’s
Revels actor William Barksted (q.v.). A Richard Machin was an actor in
Germany, 1600–6. There is no traceable connexion between either Richard
or Lewis and Henry Machyn the diarist.</p>

<p>Machin collaborated with Gervase Markham in <i>The Dumb Knight</i>
(q.v.).</p>

<p>The anonymous <i>Every Woman in Her Humour</i> and <i>Fair Maid of the
Exchange</i> have also been ascribed to him (cf. ch. xxiv).</p>


<p class="p-left p2">GERVASE MARKHAM (<i>c.</i> 1568–1637).</p>

<p>There were two Gervase Markhams, as to both of whom full details
are given in C. R. Markham, <i>Markham Memorials</i> (1913). The
dramatist was probably the third son of Robert Markham of Cotham,
Notts., a soldier and noted horseman, whose later life was devoted
to an industrious output of books, verses, romance, translations,
and treatises on horsemanship, farming, and sport. He was, said
Jonson to Drummond in 1619, ‘not of the number of the faithfull, i.e.
Poets, and but a base fellow’ (Laing, 11). Fleay, ii. 58, suggested,
on the basis of certain phrases in his <i>Tragedy of Sir Richard
Grenville</i> (1595), which has a dedication, amongst others, to the
Earl of Southampton, that he might be the ‘rival poet’ of Shakespeare’s
<i>Sonnets</i>. The other Gervase Markham was of Sedgebrook and later
of Dunham, Notts., and is not known to have been a writer. C. W.
Wallace thinks he has found a third in an ‘adventurer’ whose wagers
with actors and others on the success of an intended walk to Berwick
in 1618 led to a suit in the Court of Requests (<i>Jahrbuch</i>, xlvi.
345). But as he, like Markham of Cotham, had served in Ireland, the
two may conceivably be identical, although the adventurer had a large
family, and it is not known that Markham of Cotham had any. Markham
of Dunham, who had also served in Ireland, had but two bastards.
Conceivably Markham wrote for the Admiral’s in 1596–7 (cf. vol. ii,
p. 145). Beyond the period dealt with, he collaborated with William
Sampson in <i>Herod and Antipater</i> (1622) acted by the Revels
company at the Red Bull.</p>

description.]</p>

<i>A. B. D.</i> ii).&mdash;<i>Dissertation</i>: J. Q. Adams, <i>Every Woman
in Her Humour and The Dumb Knight</i> (1913, <i>M. P.</i> x. 413).</p>

<p>The Epistle says that ‘Rumour ... hath made strange constructions
on this Dumb Knight’, and that ‘having a partner in the wrong whose
worth hath been often approved ... I now in his absence make this
apology, both for him and me’. Presumably these ‘constructions’ led to
the withdrawal of Markham’s name from the title-page. Fleay, ii. 58,
assigned him the satirical comedy of the underplot, but Adams points
out that Markham’s books reveal no humour, and that the badly linked
underplot was probably inserted by Machin. It borrows passages from
the anonymous unprinted <i>Every Woman in Her Humour</i> (q.v.). The
production of a King’s Revels play is not likely to be before 1607, but
Herz, 102, thinks that an earlier version underlies the <i>Vom König
in Cypern</i> of Jacob Ayrer, who died 1605. A later German version
also exists, and was perhaps the <i>Philole und Mariana</i> played at
Nuremberg in 1613.</p>


<p class="p-left p2">CHRISTOPHER MARLOWE (1564–93).</p>

<p>Marlowe, whose name was also spelt Marley and Marlin, was the son of
John and Catherine Marlowe of Canterbury. He was born 6 Feb. 1564. John
Marlowe was a shoemaker and subsequently became parish clerk of St.
Mary’s. He entered the King’s School, Canterbury, in 1579 and in March
1581 matriculated with a pension on Abp. Parker’s foundation at Corpus
Christi or Benet’s College, Cambridge. He took his B.A. in 1584 and his
M.A. in 1587. In this year he probably began his literary career in
London, with <i>Tamburlaine</i>. A ballad, printed by Collier, which
represents him as a player and breaking his leg in a lewd scene on the
stage of the Curtain, is now discredited. There are satirical allusions
to him in the preface to the <i>Perimedes</i> (S. R. 29 March 1588) and
in the <i>Menaphon</i> (23 Aug. 1589) of Robert Greene, but it is very
doubtful whether, as usually assumed, Nashe had him especially in mind
when he criticized certain tragic poets of the day in his epistle to
the latter pamphlet (cf. App. C, No. xlii). On 1 Oct. 1588 ‘Christofer
Marley, of London, gentleman,’ had to give bail to appear at the next
Middlesex Sessions. The exact nature of the charge is unknown;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_419">[419]</span> but it
cannot be doubted that his personal reputation, even in the free-living
Elizabethan London, did not stand high. He is clearly the ‘famous
gracer of tragedians’ reproved for atheism in Greene’s <i>Groats-worth
of Wit</i> (1592) and it is probably to him that Chettle alludes in
his apology when he says, ‘With neither of them that take offence was
I acquainted and with one of them I care not if I never be’ (cf. App.
C, Nos. xlviii, xlix). The charge of atheism doubtless arose from
Marlowe’s association with the group of freethinkers which centred
round Sir Walter Raleigh. In 1593 these speculative tendencies brought
him into trouble. About 1591, while writing for the players of a
certain lord, as yet unidentified, he had shared a room with Thomas
Kyd (q.v.), who was then in the service of the same lord. Certain
theological notes of his got amongst Kyd’s papers and were found there
when Kyd was arrested on a charge of libel on 12 May 1593. On 18 May
the Privy Council sent a messenger to the house of Thomas Walsingham,
at Scadbury in Kent, to arrest Marlowe, and on 20 May he was ordered to
remain in attendance on the Council. There exists a ‘Note’ drawn up at
this time by one Richard Baines or Bame, containing a report of some
loose conversation of Marlowe’s which their Lordships could hardly be
expected to regard as anything but blasphemous. But, so far as Marlowe
was concerned, the proceedings were put a stop to by his sudden death.
The register of St. Nicholas, Deptford, records that he was ‘slain
by Francis Archer’ and buried there on 1 June 1593. Francis Meres’s
<i>Palladis Tamia</i> (1598) tells us that he was ‘stabbed to death
by a bawdy servingman, a rival of his in his lewde love’. Somewhat
different versions of the story are given by Thomas Beard, <i>The
Theater of God’s Judgments</i> (1597), and William Vaughan, <i>The
Golden Grove</i> (1600), both of whom use Marlowe’s fate to point the
moral against atheism. There are some rather incoherent allusions to
the event in verses affixed by Gabriel Harvey to his <i>A New Letter of
Notable Contents</i>, which is dated 16 Sept. 1593:</p>

<p class="p-left">Harvey seems to have thought in error that Marlowe died
of the plague. I do not infer from the allusions to ‘Powles’ that
Marlowe wrote for the Paul’s boys; but rather that <i>Tamburlaine</i>,
like Nashe’s pamphlets, was sold by the booksellers in St. Paul’s
Churchyard. The ‘second Shakerley’ is certainly Nashe. Surely
‘Scanderbeg’, who is ‘left behinde’, must also be Nashe, and I do
not see how Fleay, ii. 65, draws the inference that Marlowe was the
author of the lost play entered on the Stationers’ Register by Edward
Allde on 3 July 1601 as ‘the true historye of George Scanderbarge, as
yt was lately playd by the right honorable the Earle of Oxenford his
servantes’ (Arber, iii. 187). There is much satire both of Marlowe and
of Nashe in the body of <i>A New Letter</i> (Grosart, <i>Harvey</i>, i.
255).</p>

<p>There is no real doubt as to Marlowe’s authorship of
<i>Tamburlaine</i>, but the direct evidence is very slight, consisting
chiefly of Greene’s (q.v.) <i>Perimedes</i> coupling of ‘that atheist
Tamburlan’ with ‘spirits as bred of Merlin’s race’, and Harvey’s
allusion to its author as dying in 1593. Thomas Heywood, in his
prologue to <i>The Jew of Malta</i>, speaks of Alleyn’s performance in
the play. The entry printed by Collier in Henslowe’s <i>Diary</i> of
a payment to Dekker in 1597 ‘for a prolog to Marloes tambelan’ is a
forgery (Warner, 159; Greg, <i>Henslowe</i>, i. xxxix). The Admiral’s
produced ‘Tamberlan’ on 30 Aug. 1594. Henslowe marks the entry ‘j’,
which has been taken as equivalent to ‘n. e.’, Henslowe’s symbol for
a new play, and as pointing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_422">[422]</span> to a revision of the play. I feel sure,
however (cf. <i>M. L. R.</i> iv. 408), that ‘j’ only means ‘First
Part’. ‘Tamberlen’ was given fifteen times from 30 Aug. 1594 to 12 Nov.
1595, and the ‘2 pt. of tamberlen’ seven times from 19 Dec. 1594 to 13
Nov. 1595 (Henslowe, ii. 167). Tamburlaine’s cage, bridle, coat, and
breeches are included in the inventories of the Admiral’s men in 1598
(<i>Henslowe Papers</i>, 116).</p>

<p>Greene’s <i>Perimedes</i> reference suggests 1587 or early 1588 as
the probable date of <i>Tamburlaine</i>. In his preface to the 1590
edition Richard Jones says that he has omitted ‘some fond and frivolous
gestures’, but does not say whether these were by the author of the
tragic stuff. The numerous references to the play in contemporary
literature often indicate its boisterous character; e.g. T. M. <i>The
Black Book</i> (Bullen, <i>Middleton</i>, viii. 25), ‘The spindle-shank
spiders ... went stalking over his head as if they had been conning of
Tamburlaine’; T. M. <i>Father Hubburd’s Tales</i> (ibid. viii. 93),

<p>The Admiral’s men played ‘Docter ffostose’ for Henslowe twenty-four
times from 2 Oct. 1594 to Oct. 1597 (Henslowe, ii. 168). Their 1598
inventories include ‘j dragon in fostes’ (<i>Henslowe Papers</i>, 118).
Alleyn (q.v.) played the title-rôle. The entry printed by Collier from
Henslowe’s <i>Diary</i> of a payment to Dekker on 20 Dec. 1597 ‘for
adycyons to ffostus’ is a forgery (Warner, 159; Greg, <i>Henslowe</i>,
i. xxxix), but Henslowe did pay £4 to William Bird and Samuel Rowley
‘for ther adicyones in doctor fostes’ on 22 Nov. 1602 (Henslowe, i.
172). Probably, therefore, the Admiral’s revived the play about 1602–3.
These additions are doubtless the comic passages which appear for the
first time in the 1616 text, although that may also contain fragments
of the original text omitted from the 1,485 lines of 1604. The source
of the play seems to be the German <i>Faustbuch</i> (1587) through
the English <i>History of Dr. Johann Faustus</i>, of which an edition
earlier than the extant 1592 one is conjectured. A probable date is
1588–9. On 28 Feb. 1589 ‘a ballad of the life and deathe of Doctor
Faustus the great Cungerer’ was entered on S. R. (Arber, ii. 516).
There are apparent imitations of the play in <i>Taming of A Shrew</i>
(q.v.).</p>

<p>The reference in <i>The Black Book</i> (<i>vide infra</i>) can hardly
be taken as evidence that the original production was at the Theatre.</p>

<p>Greg (<i>Henslowe</i>, ii. 168) gives some support to the view of Fleay
(Ward, clxvii) that Marlowe is only responsible for part even of the
1604 text, and that the rest, including the comic matter, may have been
contributed by Dekker. But he doubts whether Dekker worked upon the
play before the date of a revision in 1594, for which there is some
evidence, such as an allusion in xi. 46 to Dr. Lopez. Fleay thought
Dekker to have been also an original collaborator, which his age hardly
permits.</p>

<p>The play seems to have formed part of the English repertories in
Germany in 1608 and 1626 (Herz, 66, 74).</p>

<p>It became the centre of a curious <i>mythos</i>, which was used to
point a moral against the stage (cf. ch. viii). Of this there are
several versions:</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) 1604. T. M. <i>The Black Book</i> (Bullen, <i>Middleton</i>,
viii. 13), ‘Hee had a head of hayre like one of my Diuells in Dr.
Faustus when the old Theater crackt and frighted the audience.’</p>

spectators) while they were there prophanely playing the History of
Faustus (the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_424">[424]</span> truth of which I have heard from many now alive, who well
remember it) there being some distracted with that feareful sight.’</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) <span class="allsmcap">N.D.</span> ‘J. G. R.’ from manuscript note on ‘the last

Gent. Mag.</i> xxxiv. 234), ‘Certaine Players at Exeter, acting upon
the stage the tragical storie of Dr. Faustus the Conjurer; as a certain
nomber of Devels kept everie one his circle there, and as Faustus was
busie in his magicall invocations, on a sudden they were all dasht,
every one harkning other in the eare, for they were all perswaded,

<p>An allusion in Marlowe’s prologue to the death of the Duc de Guise
gives a date of performance later than 23 Dec. 1588. Strange’s men
gave the play for Henslowe seventeen times from 26 Feb. 1592 to 1 Feb.
1593. Probably it belonged to Henslowe, as it was also played for him
by Sussex’s men on 4 Feb. 1594, by Sussex and the Queen’s together on
3 and 8 April 1594, by the Admiral’s on 14 May 1594, by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_425">[425]</span> either the
Admiral’s or the Chamberlain’s on 6 and 15 June 1594, and thirteen
times by the Admiral’s from 25 June 1594 to 23 June 1596 (Henslowe,
ii. 151). The 1598 inventories of the latter company include ‘j
cauderm for the Jewe’ (<i>Henslowe Papers</i>, 118). On 19 May 1601
Henslowe advanced them money to buy ‘things’ for a revival of the play
(Henslowe, i. 137). Heywood’s epistle and Cockpit prologue name Marlowe
and Alleyn as writer and actor of the play. Fleay, i. 298, suggests
that Heywood wrote the Bellamira scenes (<span class="allsmcap">III.</span> i; <span class="allsmcap">IV.</span>
iv, v; <span class="allsmcap">V.</span> i), the motive of which he used for the plot of his
<i>Captives</i>, and Greg agrees that the play shows traces of two
hands, one of which may be Heywood’s. The Dresden repertory of 1626
included a ‘Tragödie von Barabas, Juden von Malta’, but this was not
necessarily the play ‘von dem Juden’ given by English actors at Passau
in 1607 and Graz in 1608 (Herz, 66, 75).</p>

<p>Pembroke’s men seem only to have had a footing at Court in the
winter of 1592–3, and this is probably the date of the play. Greg
(<i>Henslowe</i>, ii. 224) suggests that it may have had some ‘distant
connexion’ with Chettle and Porter’s <i>The Spencers</i> and an
anonymous <i>Mortimer</i> of the Admiral’s men in 1599 and 1602
respectively. But I think <i>Mortimer</i> is a slip of Henslowe’s for
<i>Vortigern</i>.</p>

<p>Strange’s men produced ‘the tragedey of the gvyes’ as ‘n.e.’ on 26 Jan.

‘the masacer’ ten times from 21 June to 27 Sept. 1594. Possibly in Nov.
1598 and certainly in Nov. 1601 Henslowe advanced sums for costumes
for a revival of the play by the Admiral’s. The insertion by Collier
of Webster’s name in one of these entries is a forgery and whether the
lost <i>Guise</i> of this writer (q.v.) bore any relation to Marlowe’s
play is wholly unknown. On 18 Jan. 1602 Henslowe paid Alleyn £2 for
the ‘boocke’ of ‘the massaker of france’ on behalf of the company
(Henslowe, i. xlii; ii. 157). For the offence given in France by this

<p>Tanner, <i>Bibl. Britanniae</i> (1748), says, ‘Petowius in praefatione

Didonis praefixo in obitum Christoph. Marlovii</i>, ubi quatuor eius
tragediarum mentionem facit, necnon et alterius <i>de duce Guisio</i>’.
The existence of this elegy is confirmed by Warton, who saw it either
in 1734 or 1754 (<i>Hist. Eng. Poet.</i> iv. 311; cf. McKerrow, ii.
335). It was ‘inserted immediately after the title-page’, presumably
not of all copies, as it is not in the three now known. Whether
Nashe’s own share in the work was as collaborator, continuator, or
merely editor, remains uncertain. Fleay, ii. 147, gives him only
<span class="allsmcap">I.</span> i. 122 to end, <span class="allsmcap">III.</span> i, ii, iv; <span class="allsmcap">IV.</span> i,
ii, v; Knutowski regards him as responsible for only a few trifling
passages. As, moreover, the play has affinities both to early and to
late work by Marlowe, it cannot be dated. Beyond its title-page and
that of the anonymous <i>Wars of Cyrus</i> there is nothing to point
to any performances by the Chapel between 1584 and 1600. It is true
that Tucker Brooke, 389, says, ‘The one ascertained fact concerning
the history of this company during the ten years previous to 1594
seems to be that they acted before the Queen at Croydon in 1591,
under the direction of N. Giles, and Mr. Fleay assumes, apparently
with no further evidence, that <i>Dido</i> was presented on this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_427">[427]</span>
‘occasion’. But this only shows what some literary historians mean
by an ‘ascertained fact’. A company played <i>Summers Last Will and
Testament</i> (q.v.) at Croydon in 1592 and said that they had not
played for a twelvemonth. But the Queen was not present, and they are
not known to have been the Chapel, whose master was not then Nathaniel
Giles. Nor did they necessarily play twelve months before at Croydon;
and if they did, there is nothing to show that they played <i>Dido</i>.
There is nothing to connect the play with the Admiral’s <i>Dido and
Aeneas</i> of 1598 (Greg, <i>Henslowe</i>, ii. 189).</p>

<p>The attribution of the play, as it stands, to Marlowe is generally
rejected. Fleay, i. 272, supported by Greg (<i>Henslowe</i>, ii. 211),
suggests an identification with <i>The Spanish Moor’s Tragedy</i>,
which Day, Dekker, and Haughton were writing for the Admiral’s in
Feb. 1600, although the recorded payment does not show that this was
finished. They think that a play in which Marlowe had a hand may
perhaps underlie it, and attempt, not wholly in agreement with each
other, to distribute the existing scenes amongst the collaborators.</p>

III</i>.</p>


<p class="p-left p2">JOHN MARSTON (<i>c.</i> 1575–1634).</p>

<p>Marston was son of John Marston, a lawyer of Shropshire origin,
who had settled at Coventry, and his Italian wife Maria Guarsi. He
matriculated at Brasenose College, Oxford, aged 16, on 4 Feb. 1592,
and took his degree on 6 Feb. 1594. He joined the Middle Temple, and
in 1599 his father left law-books to him, ‘whom I hoped would have
profited by them in the study of the law but man proposeth and God
disposeth’. He had already begun his literary career, as a satirist
with <i>The Metamorphosis of Pygmalion’s Image and Certain Satires</i>
(1598) and <i>The Scourge of Villainy</i> (1598). For these he took
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_428">[428]</span> pseudonym of W. Kinsayder. Small, 64, has refuted the attempts
to find in them attacks on Jonson, and H. C. Hart (<i>9 N. Q.</i> xi.
282, 342) has made it plausible that by ‘Torquatus’ was meant, not
Jonson, but Gabriel Harvey. This view is now accepted by Penniman
(<i>Poetaster</i>, xxiii). On 28 Sept. 1599 Henslowe paid £2, on behalf
of the Admiral’s, for ‘M<sup>r</sup> Maxton the new poete’. The interlineated
correction ‘M<sup>r</sup> Mastone’ is a forgery (Greg, <i>Henslowe</i>, i. xlii;
ii. 206), but probably Marston was the poet. The title of the play
was left blank, and there was no further payment. It seems clearer
to me than it does to Dr. Greg that the £2 was meant to make up a
complete sum of £6 10<i>s.</i> for <i>The King of Scots</i>, and that
Marston was the ‘other Jentellman’ who collaborated with Chettle,
Dekker, and Jonson on that lost play. The setting up of the Paul’s
boys in 1599 saved Marston from Henslowe. For them he successively
revised the anonymous <i>Histriomastix</i> (q.v.), wrote the two parts
of <i>Antonio and Mellida</i> and <i>Jack Drum’s Entertainment</i>,
helped Dekker with <i>Satiromastix</i>, and finally wrote <i>What You
Will</i>. This probably accounts for all his dramatic work during
Elizabeth’s reign. In the course of it he came into conflict with
Jonson, who told Drummond in 1619 (according to the revision of the
text of Laing, 20, suggested by Penniman, <i>War</i>, 40, and Small, 3)
that ‘He had many quarrells with Marston, beat him, and took his pistol
from him, wrote his Poetaster on him; the beginning of them were,
that Marston represented him in the stage’. Marston’s representation
of Jonson as Chrysoganus in <i>Histriomastix</i> was complimentary,
that as Brabant senior in <i>Jack Drum’s Entertainment</i> offensive;
and it was doubtless the latter that stirred Jonson to retaliate on
Marston, perhaps as Hedon in <i>Cynthia’s Revels</i>, certainly as
Crispinus in <i>The Poetaster</i>. Marston’s final blow was with
Lampatho Doria in <i>What You Will</i>. When the theatres reopened in
1604 Marston seems to have left the Paul’s boys and taken a share in
the syndicate formed to exploit the Queen’s Revels, for whom the rest
of his plays were written. He was now on friendly terms with Jonson, to
whom he dedicated his <i>Malcontent</i> and for whose <i>Sejanus</i>
he wrote congratulatory verses. Possibly further friction arose
over the unfortunate collaboration of Jonson, Marston, and Chapman
in <i>Eastward Ho!</i>, for the chief indiscretion in which Marston
seems to have been responsible, and may have stimulated a sarcasm on
Jonson in the Epistle to <i>Sophonisba</i>. In 1608 Marston’s career
as a dramatist abruptly terminated. An abstract of the Privy Council
Register has the brief note on 8 June, ‘John Marston committed to
Newgate’ (F. P. Wilson from <i>Addl. MS.</i> 11402, f. 141, in <i>M. L.
R.</i> ix. 99). I conjecture that he was the author of the Blackfriars
play (cf. ch. xii, s.v. Chapel) which hit at James’s explorations
after Scottish silver. He disappeared, selling his interest in the
Blackfriars company, then or in 1605, to Robert Keysar, and leaving
<i>The Insatiate Countess</i> unfinished. He had taken orders by 10
Oct. 1616 when he obtained the living of Christchurch, Hampshire. This
he resigned on 13 Sept. 1631. In 1633 he was distant from London, but
died on 25 June 1634 in Aldermanbury parish. He had married Mary,
probably the daughter of William Wilkes, one of James’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_429">[429]</span> chaplains,
of whom Jonson said in 1619 (Laing, 16) that ‘Marston wrott his
Father-in-lawes preachings, and his Father-in-law his Commedies’. If
we trust the portrait of Crispinus in <i>The Poetaster</i>, he had red
hair and little legs. A letter from Marston to Sir Gervase Clifton,
endorsed ‘Poet Marston’, is calendared in <i>Hist. MSS. Various
Coll.</i> vii. 389; it is undated, but must, from the names used, be of
1603–8.</p>

<p>In <span class="allsmcap">V.</span> i of Part i a painter brings in two pictures, one dated
‘Anno Domini, 1599’, the other ‘Aetatis suae 24’. I agree with Small,
92, that these are probably real dates and that the second indicates
Marston’s own age. As he must have completed his twenty-fourth year
by 3 Feb. 1600 at latest, Part i was probably produced in 1599. The
prologue of Part ii speaks of winter as replacing summer, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_430">[430]</span> probably
therefore Part i is to be dated in the summer, and Part ii in the early
winter of 1599. Clearly the painter scene cannot, as Fleay, ii. 75,
suggests, be motived by a casual allusion to a painter in <i>Cynthia’s
Revels</i> (F<sub>1</sub>) 2673 or the painter scene added on revision to Kyd’s
<i>Spanish Tragedy</i>, since both are later. The ‘armed Epilogue’
of Part i seems to me clearly a criticism of the armed prologue of
Jonson’s <i>Poetaster</i> (1601); it may have been an addition of 1601.
Part ii, prol. 13, 23, calls the theatre ‘round’ and ‘ring’.</p>

<p>Bullen, Fleay, ii. 76, Small, 101, and Aronstein agree in regarding the
play as written in 1601 by way of answer to <i>Cynthia’s Revels</i>,
and they are probably right. Small shows that, in spite of the fact
that Quadratus calls Lampatho Doria a ‘Don Kynsader’ (<span class="allsmcap">II.</span> i.
134), Lampatho must stand for Jonson, and Quadratus to some extent for
Marston himself. Perhaps Simplicius Faber is the unidentified Asinius
Bubo of <i>Satiromastix</i>. Both Fleay and Small think that the play
has been revised before publication, partly because of confusion in the
names of the characters, and partly because of the absence of the kind
of Marstonian language which Jonson satirized. Small goes so far as to
suggest that the seventeen untraceable words vomited by Crispinus in
<i>The Poetaster</i> came from <i>What You Will</i>, and that Marston
rewrote the play and eliminated them. The rest of Fleay’s conjectures
about the play seem to me irresponsible. If the play dates from 1601,
it may reasonably be assigned to the Paul’s boys. The induction, with
its allusions to the small size of the stage and the use of candles,
excludes the possibility of an adult theatre.</p>

<p>As a Queen’s Revels play, this must have been on the stage at least
as late as 1603, and the clear proof of Crawford, ii. 1, that several
passages are verbal imitations of Florio’s translation of Montaigne,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_431">[431]</span>
published in that year, make it difficult to put it earlier, although
Wallace, ii. 75, says that he has evidence, which he does not give,
for production in 1602. On the other hand, C. R. Baskervill (<i>M. L.
A.</i> xxiv. 718) argues that the plot influenced that of <i>The Fair
Maid of Bristow</i>, which was performed at Court during the winter
of 1603–4. The play is referred to with <i>Eastward Ho!</i> (q.v.) as
bringing trouble on Marston by A. Nixon, <i>The Black Year</i> (1606).
It was revived for the Court by the Lady Elizabeth’s on 25 Feb. 1613,
under the name of <i>Cockle de Moye</i> from one of the characters, and
repeated on 12 Dec. 1613 (cf. App. B).</p>

<p>The induction, in which parts are taken by Sly, Sinklo, Burbadge,

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Sly.</i> ... I would know how you came by this play?</p>

<p><i>Condell.</i> Faith, sir, the book was lost; and because ’twas
pity so good a play should be lost, we found it and play it.</p>

interest in it.</p>

<p><i>Condell.</i> Why not Malevole in folio with us, as Jeronimo
in decimosexto with them? They taught us a name for our play; we
call it <i>One for Another</i>.</p>

<p><i>Sly.</i> What are your additions?</p>

<p><i>Burbadge.</i> Sooth, not greatly needful; only as your salad
to your great feast, to entertain a little more time, and to
abridge the not-received custom of music in our theatre.</p>
</div>

<p>Stoll, 57, rightly argues that Small, 115, is not justified in ignoring
the evidence of the title-page and assigning the insertions, as well
as the induction, to Webster rather than Marston. On the other hand,
I think he himself ignores the evidence of Burbadge’s speech in the
induction, when he takes the undramatic quality of the insertions as
proof that Marston did not write them first in 1604, but revived them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_432">[432]</span>
from his original text, which the boy actors had shortened. He puts
this original text in 1600, because of the allusion in one of the
insertions (<span class="allsmcap">I.</span> iii. 20) to a ‘horn growing in the woman’s
forehead twelve years since’. This horn was described in a pamphlet of
1588. I do not share his view that ‘twelve’ must be a precise and not a
round number. Sly says in the induction:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘This play hath beaten all your gallants out of the feathers:
Blackfriars hath almost spoiled Blackfriars for feathers.’</p>
</div>

<p class="p-left">It is clear therefore that the original actors were the
Blackfriars boys, and there is nothing else to suggest a connexion
between Marston and these boys during Elizabeth’s reign. Small, 115,
points out a reference to the Scots in <span class="allsmcap">V.</span> iii. 24 which should
be Jacobean. I think that this is Marston’s first play for the Queen’s
Revels after the formation of the syndicate early in 1604, and that
the revision followed later in the same year. It is not necessary to
assume that the play was literally ‘lost’ or that Marston was not privy
to the adoption of it by the King’s. Importance is attached to the
date by parallels to certain plays of Shakespeare, where Stoll thinks
that Shakespeare was the borrower. I do not see how it can be so. The
epilogue speaks of the author’s ‘reformed Muse’ and pays a compliment
to ‘another’s happier Muse’ and forthcoming ‘Thalia’, perhaps Jonson’s
<i>Volpone</i>.</p>

<p>As a Queen’s Revels play, this must date from 1604 or 1605; presumably
it was transferred to Paul’s by Edward Kirkham, when he took charge
of them for the Christmas of 1605–6. Small, 116, refutes Aronstein’s
suggested allusion to Jonson’s <i>Volpone</i> of 1605 or 1606. Bolte,
<i>Danziger Theater</i>, 177, prints from a seventeenth-century
Dantzig MS. a German play, <i>Tiberius von Ferrara und Annabella von
Mömpelgart</i>, which is in part derived from <i>The Fawn</i> (Herz,
99). If, as the titles suggest, the performances of <i>Annabella,
eines Hertzogen Tochter von Ferrara</i> at Nördlingen in 1604,
of <i>Annabella, eines Markgraffen Tochter von Montferrat</i> at
Rothenburg in 1604, and of <i>Herzog von Ferrara</i> at Dresden in
1626 (Herz, 65, 66), indicate intermediate links, <i>The Fawn</i>
cannot be later than 1604. Yet I find it impossible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_433">[433]</span> not to attach
some value to the argument of Stoll, <i>Webster</i>, 17, for a date
later than the execution of Sir Everard Digby on 30 Jan. 1606 (Stowe,
<i>Annales</i>, 881), which appears to be alluded to in <span class="allsmcap">IV.</span>
i. 310, ‘Nay, heed me, a woman that will thrust in crowds,&mdash;a lady,
that, being with child, ventures the hope of her womb,&mdash;nay, gives
two crowns for a room to behold a goodly man three parts alive,
quartered, his privities hackled off, his belly lanched up’. It is true
that there were also quarterings for treason on 29 Nov. 1603 (Stowe,
<i>Annales</i>, ed. Howes, 831), but these were in Winchester; also
that contemporary notices, such as that in Stowe and the narratives
in J. Morris, <i>Catholics under James I</i>, 216, and in <i>Somers
Tracts</i> (1809), ii. 111, which describes the victims as ‘proper men,
in shape’, afford no confirmation of indecent crowds in 1606, but the
cumulative effect of the quadruple allusions here, in Day’s <i>Isle of
Gulls</i> (q.v.), in Sharpham’s <i>Fleir</i> (q.v.), and in Middleton’s
<i>Michaelmas Term</i> (q.v.) is pretty strong. The passage quoted by
Crawford, ii. 40, from Montaigne is hardly particular enough to explain
that in the <i>Fawn</i>. I do not like explaining discrepancies by the
hypothesis of a revision, but if Kirkham revived the <i>Fawn</i> at
Paul’s in 1606, he is not unlikely to have had it written up a bit.
The epistle refers to ‘the factious malice and studied detractions’ of
fellow-dramatists, perhaps an echo of Marston’s relations with Jonson
and Chapman over <i>Eastward Ho!</i></p>

<p>The mention of Blackfriars without the name of a company points to a
performance after Anne’s patronage had been withdrawn from the Revels
boys, late in 1605 or early in 1606, not, as Fleay, ii. 79, suggests,
to one by the Chapel in 1602–3. Some features of staging (cf. ch. xxi)
raise a suspicion that the play may have been taken over from Paul’s.
The resemblance of the title to that of <i>Wonder of a Woman</i>
produced by the Admiral’s in 1595 is probably accidental. The epistle
glances at Jonson’s translations in <i>Sejanus</i> (1603).</p>

<p>It is generally supposed that Marston began the play and that Barksted
(q.v.) finished it. Two lines (<span class="allsmcap">V.</span> ii. 244–5) appear verbatim
in Barksted’s <i>Mirrha</i> (1607). Small traces several other clear
parallels with both <i>Mirrha</i> and <i>Hiren</i>, as well as
stylistic qualities pointing to Barksted rather than to Marston, and
concludes that the play is Barksted’s on a plot drafted by Marston.
It may be conjectured that Marston left the fragment when he got into
trouble for the second time in 1608, and that the revision was more
probably for the Queen’s Revels at Whitefriars in 1609–11 than for the
conjoint Queen’s Revels and Lady Elizabeth’s in 1613. Hardly any of the
suggestions on the play in Fleay, ii. 80, bear analysis.</p>

<p>On arrival, in the park, at an ‘antique gate’ with complimentary
inscriptions, were speeches by Merimna an enchantress, and Saturn; at
the top of the stairs to the great chamber another speech by Merimna
and a gift of a waistcoat.</p>

<p>Later in the great chamber was a mask by four knights and four
gentlemen, in carnation and white, and vizards like stars, representing
sons of Mercury, with pages in blue, and Cynthia and Ariadne as
presenters. A traverse ‘slided away’, and disclosed the presenters
on clouds. Later a second traverse ‘sank down’, and the maskers
appeared throned at the top of a wood. They danced ‘a new measure’,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_435">[435]</span>
then ‘presented their shields’, and took out the ladies for measures,
galliards, corantos and lavoltas. ‘The night being much spent’, came
their ‘departing measure’.</p>

<p>At departure were an eclogue by a shepherd and a nymph, and a gift of a
cabinet by Niobe in the little park.</p>



<p class="center p1"><i>Mountebank’s Mask. 1618</i> (?)</p>

<p>The ascription to Marston of this Gray’s Inn mask rests on an
unverifiable assertion by Collier (cf. Bullen, <i>Marston</i>, iii.
418; Brotanek, 356), and the known dates of Marston’s career render it
extremely improbable.</p>


<p class="p-left p2">JOHN MASON (1581–2&mdash;?).</p>

<p>The degree boasted on his title-page leads to the identification of
Mason as a son of Richard Mason, priest, of Cavendish, Suffolk, and
pupil of Bury St. Edmunds school, who matriculated from Caius College,
Cambridge, as a sizar at the age of fourteen on 6 July 1596, and took
the degree of B.A. in 1601 and M.A. in 1606 from St. Catharine’s Hall.
He was a member of the King’s Revels syndicate in 1608, and nothing
further is known of him, since the combination of names is too common
to justify his identification with the schoolmaster of Camberwell,
Surrey, whose school-play is described in <i>Princeps Rhetoricus</i>
(1648; cf. C. S. Northup in <i>E. S.</i> xlv. 154).</p>

<p>As a King’s Revels play this may be put in 1607–8. An earlier date
has been thought to be indicated by <i>Eastward Ho!</i> (1605),
<span class="allsmcap">II.</span> ii. 41, ‘<i>Via</i>, the curtaine that shaddowed Borgia’,
but if the reference is to a play, Borgia may well have figured in
other plays. A play ‘Vom Turcken’ was taken by Spencer to Nuremberg in
1613 (Herz, 66).</p>


<p class="p-left p2">CHARLES MASSEY.</p>

<p>For his career as an actor, cf. ch. xv.</p>

<p>He apparently wrote <i>Malcolm King of Scots</i> for the Admiral’s, to

<p class="p-left p2">PHILIP MASSINGER (1583–1640).</p>

<p>Massinger, baptized at Salisbury on 24 Nov. 1583, was son of Arthur
Massinger, a confidential servant of Henry, 2nd Earl of Pembroke. He
entered at St. Alban Hall, Oxford, and left without a degree in 1606.
Little is known of him for some years thereafter. He is conjectured to
have become a Catholic and thus to have imperilled his relations with
the Herbert family, at any rate until the time of Philip, the 4th earl,
who was certainly his patron. He was buried at St. Saviour’s on 18
March 1640 and left a widow. The greater part of his dramatic career,
to which all his independent plays belong, falls outside the scope of
this notice, but on 4 July 1615 he gave a joint bond with Daborne for
£3 to Henslowe, and some undated correspondence probably of 1613 shows
that he was collaborating in one or more plays with Daborne, Field, and
Fletcher.</p>

Sir Edward Dering.</p>

<p><i>Editions</i> by J. O. Halliwell (1846, <i>Sh. Soc.</i>), J. S.
Farmer (1909, <i>T. F. T.</i>).</p>

<p>The MS. has a title-page, with the date 1579, an arrangement of the
parts for six actors and the title ‘The &mdash;&mdash; of a Marige betweene wit
and wisdome very frutefull and mixed full of pleasant mirth as well
for The beholders as the Readers or hearers neuer before imprinted’.
There are nine Scenes in two Acts, with a Prologue and Epilogus. The
characters are almost wholly allegorical. Idleness is ‘the vice’. The
stage-directions mention a ‘stage’. Halliwell prints the mutilated
word left blank in the title above as ‘Contract’, no doubt rightly.
Conceivably the play was in fact printed in 1579, as ‘Mariage of
wit and wisdome’ is in Rogers and Ley’s play-list of 1656 (Greg,
<i>Masques</i>, lxxxvii).</p>

<p>The play might be identical with the lost Paul’s moral of <i>The
Marriage of Mind and Measure</i> (cf. App. B), which also belongs to
1579. Fleay, ii. 287, 294, infers from a not very conclusive reference
to a ‘King’ in sc. iv that it dates from the time of Edward VI. He also
identifies it with the <i>Hit Nail o’ th’ Head</i> named in <i>Sir
Thomas More</i> (q.v.) because that phrase is quoted in the Epilogus,
curiously disregarding the fact that the <i>Sir Thomas More</i> list
names the play under its existing title as distinct from <i>Hit Nail o’
th’ Head</i>. Most of the plays in the <i>Sir Thomas More</i> list seem
to be pre-Elizabethan; cf. <i>Mediaeval Stage</i>, ii. 200.</p>


<p class="p-left p2">THOMAS MIDDLETON (<i>c.</i> 1570–1627).</p>

<p>Thomas Middleton was a Londoner and of a gentle family. The date of
his birth can only be roughly conjectured from the probability that
he was one of two Thomas Middletons who entered Gray’s Inn in 1593
and 1596, and of his earlier education nothing is known. His first
work was <i>The Wisdom of Solomon Paraphrased</i> (1597), and he may
be the T. M. of <i>The Black Book</i> (1604) and other pamphlets in
prose and verse. He appears as a dramatist, possibly as early as 1599
in <i>The Old Law</i> and certainly in Henslowe’s diary during 1602,
writing an unnamed play for Worcester’s men, and for the Admiral’s
<i>Caesar’s Fall or The Two Shapes</i> with Dekker (q.v), Drayton,
Munday, and Webster, and by himself, <i>Randal Earl of Chester</i>, and
a prologue and epilogue to Greene’s <i>Friar Bacon</i> (q.v.). This
work is all lost, but by 1604 he had also collaborated with Dekker for
the Admiral’s in the extant <i>Honest Whore</i>. From 1602, if not from
1599, to the end of their career in 1606 or 1607, he was also writing
diligently for the Paul’s boys. I think he is referred to with their
other ‘apes and guls’, Marston and Dekker, in Marston’s <i>Jack Drum’s
Entertainment</i> (1600), <span class="allsmcap">IV.</span> 40:</p>

i. e. <i>Poets</i>, and but a base fellow’ (Laing, 12). Occasional
plays for several companies and the beginnings of employment in city
pageantry occupied 1607–16, and to later periods belong a fruitful
partnership with William Rowley for Prince Charles’s men, and some
slight share in the heterogeneous mass of work that passes under the
names of Beaumont and Fletcher. He also wrote a few independent plays,
of which <i>A Game at Chess</i> (1624) got him into political trouble.
At some time before 1623 a few lines of his got interpolated into the
text of <i>Macbeth</i> (cf. <i>Warwick</i> edition, p. 164). In 1620 he
obtained a post as Chronologer to the City. He married Maria Morbeck,
had a son Edward, and dwelt at Newington Butts, where he was buried on
4 July 1627.</p>

(q.v.).&mdash;<i>Dissertation</i>: E. E. Morris, <i>On the Date and
Composition of T. O. L.</i> (<i>M. L. A.</i> xvii. 1).</p>

<p>It is generally supposed that in some form the play dates from 1599, as
in <span class="allsmcap">III.</span> i. 34 a woman was ‘born in an. 1540, and now ’tis 99’.
Of the three authors only Middleton can then have been writing. Morris,
after elaborate study of the early work and the versification of all
three, concludes that Rowley (<i>c.</i> 1615) and Massinger (<i>c.</i>
1625) successively revised an original by Middleton. The Paul’s plays
began in 1599, but it cannot be assumed that this was one of them.
Stork, 48, doubts the 1599 date and is inclined to assume collaboration
between the three writers <i>c.</i> 1615.</p>

<p>The date of Q<sub>1</sub> is doubtless 1608/9 and the Court performance that by

<p>The prologue apologizes that ‘expectation’ hath not ‘filled the general
round’. The King’s Revels can hardly have existed before 1607. Fleay,
ii. 94, thinks that they inherited the play from Paul’s and assigns
it to 1604 ‘when the Family of Love were such objects<span class="pagenum" id="Page_441">[441]</span> of public
attention’. His chief reason is that the epistle regrets that the play
was ‘not published when the general voice of the people had sealed
it for good, and the newness of it made it much more desired than at
this time’. It had ‘passed the censure of the stage with a general
applause’. This epistle is clearly by the author, who says ‘it was
in the press before I had notice of it, by which means some faults
may escape in the printing’. I agree that there must have been some
interval between production and publication. But there is no special
virtue in the date 1604. References to the Family of Love are to be
found in <i>Sir Giles Goosecap</i> (<i>1601–3</i>), <span class="allsmcap">II.</span> i.
263; <i>Dutch Courtesan</i> (<i>1603–4</i>), <span class="allsmcap">I.</span> i. 156,

<span class="allsmcap">I.</span> ii. 73; <i>Isle of Gulls</i> (<i>1606</i>), p. 26; <i>Every
Woman in Her Humour</i> (?), p. 316. The sect was well known in England
as early as 1574–81, when an act was passed for its suppression. It
petitioned James <i>c.</i> 1604 and was answered in <i>A Supplication
of the Family of Love</i>, printed at Cambridge in 1606. On its
history, cf. Fuller, <i>Church History</i> (1868), iii. 239; F.

<p>Bullen places this ‘from internal evidence’ <i>c.</i> 1608–9, but
thinks it revised at a later date, not improbably by Fletcher, although
he cannot discover either Jonson’s hand or, ‘unless the songs be his’,
Fletcher’s. Allusions to ‘a scornful woman’ (<span class="allsmcap">I.</span> ii. 104) and
to ‘yellow bands’ as ‘hateful’ (<span class="allsmcap">V.</span> i. 52) are consistent with

<p>There is a mention (<span class="allsmcap">V.</span> i. 112) of Fletcher’s <i>Wild-Goose
Chase</i> (1621), and the introduction of a ‘rebel Oliver’ suggests
a much later date. But Bullen thinks this an old play revised, and
Fleay, ii. 104, attempts to identify it with an anonymous play called
both <i>Vortigern</i> and <i>Hengist</i> (Greg, <i>Henslowe</i>, ii.
181) which was produced by the Admiral’s on 4 Dec. 1596 and bought by
the same company from Alleyn in 1601. There is not, however, much to
support a theory that Middleton was writing for the stage so early as
1596. Stork, 46, thinks that Middleton and Rowley revised the older
play <i>c.</i> 1606, ‘at a time when plays of ancient Britain were in
vogue’.</p>

<p class="p-left p2">ANTHONY MUNDAY (<i>c.</i> 1553–1633).</p>

<p>Anthony was son of Christopher Munday, a London Draper. He ‘first was
a stage player’ (<i>A True Report of ... M. Campion</i>, 1582), but in
Oct. 1576 was apprenticed for eight years to John Allde, stationer.
Allde went out of business about 1582, and Munday never completed his
apprenticeship, probably because his ready pen found better profit in
the purveyance of copy for the trade. He began by a journey to Rome
in 1578–9, and brought back material for a series of attacks upon the
Jesuits, to one of which <i>A True Report of ... M. Campion</i> is an
answer. According to the anonymous author, Munday on his return to
England ‘did play extempore, those gentlemen and others whiche were
present, can best giue witnes of his dexterity, who being wery of his
folly, hissed him from his stage. Then being thereby discouraged, he
set forth a balet against playes, but yet (o constant youth) he now
beginnes againe to ruffle upon the stage’. For the ballad there is
some corroborative evidence in a S. R. entry of 10 Nov. 1580 (cf.
App. C, No. xxvi), which, however, does not name Munday, and it is a
possible conjecture that he also wrote the <i>Third Blast of Retrait
from Plaies</i> issued in the same year (cf. App. C, No. xxvii). If
so, he was already, before 1580, doing work as a playwright; but of
this, with the doubtful exception of the anonymous <i>Two Italian
Gentlemen</i> (q.v.), there is no other evidence for another fifteen
years. His experiences as an actor may have been with the company of
the Earl of Oxford, whose ‘servant’ he calls himself in his <i>View of
Sundry Examples</i> (1580). From 1581 he was employed by Topcliffe and
others against recusants, and as a result became, possibly by 1584 and
certainly by 1588, a Messenger of the Chamber. He still held this post
in 1593, and was employed as a pursuivant to execute the Archbishop of
Canterbury’s warrants against Martin Marprelate in 1588. J. D. Wilson
(<i>M. L. R.</i> iv. 489) suggests that he may also have taken a hand
in the literary and dramatic controversy, as ‘Mar-Martin, John a Cant:
his hobbie-horse’, who ‘was to his reproche, newly put out of the
morris, take it how he will; with a flat discharge for euer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_445">[445]</span> shaking
his shins about a maypole againe while he liued’ (<i>Protestation
of Martin Marprelate</i>, <i>c.</i> Aug. 1589). Certainly Munday’s
official duties did not interfere with his literary productiveness, as
translator of romances, maker of ballads, lyrist, and miscellaneous
writer generally. He is traceable, chiefly in Henslowe’s diary, as a
busy dramatist for the Admiral’s men during various periods between
1594 and 1602, and there is no reason to suppose that his activities
were limited to these years. Meres in 1598 includes him amongst
‘the best for comedy’, with the additional compliment of ‘our best
plotter’. But he was evidently a favourite mark for the satire of
more literary writers, who depreciated his style and jested at his
functions as a messenger. Small, 172, has disposed of attempts to
identify him with the Deliro or the Puntarvolo of <i>E. M. O.</i>,
the Amorphus of <i>Cynthia’s Revels</i>, the In-and-In Medley of the
<i>Tale of a Tub</i>, and the Timothy Tweedle of the anonymous <i>Jack
Drum’s Entertainment</i>. But he may reasonably be taken for the Poet
Nuntius of <i>E. M. I.</i> and the Antonio Balladino of <i>The Case
is Altered</i> (q.v.); and long before Jonson took up the game, an
earlier writer had introduced him as the Posthaste of the anonymous
<i>Histriomastix</i> (c. 1589). Posthaste suggests the formation of
Sir Oliver Owlet’s men, and acts as their poet (i. 124). He writes a
<i>Prodigal Child</i> at 1<i>s.</i> a sheet (ii. 94). He will teach the
actors to play ‘true Politicians’ (i. 128) and ‘should be employd in
matters of state’ (ii. 130). He is always ready to drink (i. 162; ii.
103, 115, 319; vi. 222), and claims to be a gentleman, because ‘he hath
a clean shirt on, with some learning’ (ii. 214). He has written ballads
(v. 91; vi. 235). The players jeer at ‘your extempore’ (i. 127), and he
offers to do a prologue extempore (ii. 121), and does extemporize on a
theme (ii. 293). He writes with</p>

        <div class="i4h">no new luxury or blandishment</div>

<p class="p-left">The players call him, when he is late for rehearsal,
a ‘peaking pageanter’, and say ‘It is as dangerous to read his name
at a play door, as a printed bill on a plague door’ (iv. 165). The
whole portrait seems to be by the earlier author; Marston only adds
a characteristic epithet in ‘goosequillian Posthast’ (iii. 187).
But it agrees closely with the later portraits by Jonson, and with
the facts of Munday’s career. I do not think that ‘pageanter’ means
anything more than play-maker. But from 1605 onwards Munday was often
employed by city companies to devise Lord Mayor’s pageants, and it has
been supposed that he had been similarly engaged since 1592 on the
strength of a claim in the 1618 edition of John Stowe’s <i>Survey of
London</i>, which he edited, that he had been ‘six and twenty years
in sundry employments for the City’s service’. But there were other
civic employments, and it is doubtful (cf. ch. iv) how far there were
pageants during the last decade of Elizabeth’s reign for Munday to
devise. On the title-pages of his pageants he describes himself as
a ‘Cittizen and Draper of London’. The Corporation’s welcome at the
creation of Henry as Prince of Wales in 1610 (cf. ch. iv) also fell to
him to devise. How<span class="pagenum" id="Page_446">[446]</span> long he continued to write plays is unknown. He had
several children in St. Giles’s, Cripplegate, between 1584 and 1589,
and was buried on 10 Aug. 1633 at St. Stephen’s, Coleman Street.</p>

‘The Booke of John a Kent and John a Cumber’, and at end the signature
‘Anthony Mundy’, and in another hand the date ‘&mdash;&mdash; Decembris 1596’. A

<p>The date has been misread ‘1595’. Greg (<i>Henslowe</i>, ii. 172)
agrees with Fleay, ii. 114, that the play, of which the scene is at
West Chester, must be <i>The Wise Man of West Chester</i>, produced
by the Admiral’s on 3 Dec. 1594 and played to 18 July 1597. Their
inventory of 1598 (<i>Henslowe Papers</i>, 117) includes ‘Kentes woden
leage’. This is not required by the extant text, but two or three
leaves of the MS. appear to be missing. If the identification is
correct, it is not easy to see how the MS. can be earlier than 1594,
although Sir E. M. Thompson’s warning that the date of 1596 may be a
later addition is justified. On 19 Sept. 1601 the Admiral’s bought
the book from Alleyn. Greg further suggests that <i>Randal Earl of
Chester</i>, written by Middleton for the same company in Oct. and Nov.
1602, may have been a ‘refashioning’ of the earlier play, in which
Randal is a character.</p>

<p>Henslowe paid Munday £5 on behalf of the Admiral’s for ‘the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_447">[447]</span> firste
parte of Robyne Hoode’ on 15 Feb. 1598. From 20 Feb. to 8 March he paid
Munday and Chettle sums amounting to £5 in all for a ‘seconde parte’,
called in the fullest entry ‘seconde parte of the downefall of earlle
Huntyngton surnamed Roben Hoode’. The books and apparel and properties
are in the Admiral’s inventories of March 1598 (<i>Henslowe Papers</i>,
114, 115, 120, 121). Both parts were licensed for performance on 28
March. On 18 Nov. he paid Chettle 10<i>s.</i> for ‘the mendynge of’
the first part, and on 25 Nov., apparently, another 10<i>s.</i> ‘for
mendinge of Roben Hood for the corte’. Greg (<i>Henslowe</i>, ii.
190) suggests that the last payment was for the second part, and that
the two Court performances by the Admiral’s at Christmas 1598 are of
these plays. However this may be, Henslowe’s <i>1, 2 Robin Hood</i>
are doubtless the extant <i>Downfall</i> and <i>Death</i>. There is an
allusion in <i>The Downfall</i>, <span class="allsmcap">IV.</span> ii, to the ‘merry jests’
of an earlier play, which may be <i>The Pastoral Comedy of Robin Hood
and Little John</i>, entered in S. R. on 14 May 1594, but not now

Munday’s scenes, added the Induction and the Skeltonic rhymes.</p>

Henslowe’s entries afford no evidence that Munday revised Chettle’s
work, as Fleay thinks. Greg (<i>Henslowe</i>, ii. 191) points out that
Davenport borrowed much of his <i>King John and Matilda</i> (1655) from

<p class="p-left p2">THOMAS NASHE (1507–&gt;1601).</p>

<p>Nashe was baptized at Lowestoft, Suffolk, in Nov. 1567, the son of
William Nashe, minister, of a Herefordshire family. He matriculated
from St. John’s, Cambridge, on 13 Oct. 1582, took his B.A. in 1586, and
left the University probably in 1588. According to the <i>Trimming</i>
(Harvey, iii. 67), he ‘had a hand in a Show called Terminus &amp; non
terminus, for which his partener in it was expelled the Colledge: but
this foresaid Nashe played in it (as I suppose) the Varlet of Clubs;
which he acted with such naturall affection, that all the spectators
tooke him to be the verie same’. He went to London, and his first book,
<i>The Anatomie of Absurditie</i>, was entered in S. R. on 19 Sept.
1588. In actual publication it was anticipated by an epistle ‘To the
Gentlemen Students of Both Universities’, which he prefixed to the
<i>Menaphon</i> (1589) of Robert Greene (cf. App. C, No. xlii). This
contains some pungent criticism of actors, with incidental depreciation
of certain illiterate dramatists, among whom is apparently included
Kyd, coupled with praise of Peele, and of other ‘sweete gentlemen’,
who have ‘tricked vp a company of taffata fooles with their feathers’.
Evidently Nashe had joined the London circle of University wits, and
henceforth lived, partly by his pen, as dramatist and pamphleteer, and
partly by services rendered to various patrons, amongst whom were Lord
Strange, Sir George Carey, afterwards Lord Hunsdon, and Archbishop
Whitgift. His connexion with this last was either the cause or the
result of his employment, with other literary men, notably Lyly, in
opposition to the anti-episcopalian tracts of Martin Marprelate and his
fellows. His precise share in the controversy is uncertain. He has been
credited with <i>An Almond for a Parrot</i>, with a series of writings
under the name of Pasquil, and with other contributions, but in all
cases the careful analysis of McKerrow, v. 49, finds the evidence quite
inconclusive.</p>

<p>McKerrow, too, has given the best account (v. 65) of Nashe’s quarrel
with Gabriel and Richard Harvey. This arose out of his association
as an anti-Martinist with Lyly, between whom and Gabriel there was
an ancient feud. It was carried on, in a vein of scurrilous personal
raillery on both sides, from 1590 until it was suppressed as a public
scandal in 1599. One of the charges against Nashe was his friendship
with, and in the Harveian view aping of, Robert Greene, with whom,
according to Gabriel’s <i>Four Letters</i> (<i>Works</i>, i. 170),
Nashe took part in the fatal banquet of pickled herrings and Rhenish
which brought him to his end. Nashe repudiated the charge of imitation,
and spoke of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_451">[451]</span> Greene in <i>Have With You to Saffron Walden</i> (iii.
132), as ‘subscribing to mee in anything but plotting Plaies, wherein
he was his crafts master’. Unless <i>Dido</i> is early work, no play
written by Nashe before Greene’s death on 3 Sept. 1592 is known to us.
But he is pretty clearly the ‘young Iuuenall, that byting Satyrist,
that lastly with mee together writ a Comedie’ of Greene’s posthumous
<i>Groats-worth</i> (cf. App. C, No. xlviii), and the tone of his own
Defence of Plays in <i>Pierce Penilesse</i> of 1592 (cf. App. C, No.
xlvi) as compared with that of the <i>Menaphon</i> epistle suggests
that he had made his peace with the ‘taffata fooles’. His one extant
unaided play belongs to the autumn of 1592, and was apparently for a
private performance at Croydon. Internal evidence enables us to date
in Aug.–Oct. 1596, and to ascribe to Nashe, in spite of the fact that
his name at the foot is in a nineteenth-century writing, a letter to
William Cotton (McKerrow, v. 192, from <i>Cott. MS. Julius C.</i> iii,
f. 280) which shows that he was still writing for the stage and gives
valuable evidence upon the theatrical crisis of that year (App. D, No.
cv). To 1597 belongs the misadventure of <i>The Isle of Dogs</i>, which
sent Nashe in flight to Great Yarmouth, and probably ended his dramatic
career. He is mentioned as dead in C. Fitzgeffrey, <i>Affaniae</i>
(1601).</p>

<p>The play was intended for performance on the ‘tyle-stones’ and in the
presence of a ‘Lord’, to whom there are several other references, in
one of which he is ‘your Grace’ (ll. 17, 205, 208, 587, 795, 1897,
1925). There are also local references to ‘betweene this and Stretham’
(l. 202), to ‘Dubbers hill’ near Croydon (l. 621), to Croydon itself
(ll. 1830, 1873), and to ‘forlorne’ Lambeth (l. 1879). The conclusion
seems justified that ‘this lowe built house’ (l. 1884) was the palace
of Archbishop Whitgift at Croydon.</p>

<p>There was a plague ‘in this latter end of summer’ (l. 80); which had
been ‘brought in’ by the dog-days (l. 656), and had led to ‘want of
terme’ and consequent ‘Cities harm’ in London (l. 1881). Summer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_452">[452]</span>

<p class="p-left">The plague and absence of term from London might fit
either 1592 or 1593 (cf. App. E), but I agree with McKerrow, iv. 418,
that the earlier year is indicated. In 1593 the plague did not begin
in the dog-days, nor did Elizabeth go on progress. And it is on 6
Sept. 1592 that Stowe (1615), 764, records the emptying of Thames. I
may add a small confirmatory point. Are not ‘the horses lately sworne
to be stolne’ (l. 250) those stolen by Germans in the train of Count
Mompelgard between Reading and Windsor and referred to in <i>Merry
Wives</i>, <span class="allsmcap">IV.</span> v. 78. The Count came to Windsor on 19 Aug.
1592 (Rye, xcix). Now I part company with Mr. McKerrow, who thinks
that, although the play was written in 1592, it may have been revised
for performance before Elizabeth in a later year, perhaps at her visit
to Whitgift on 14 Aug. 1600. His reasons are three: (<i>a</i>) Sol’s
reference to the Thames seems to date it in a year earlier than that
in which he speaks; (<i>b</i>) the seasonal references suggest August,
while Stowe’s date necessitates September at earliest, and the want of
term points to October; (<i>c</i>) the references to Elizabeth imply
her presence. I think there is something in (<i>a</i>), but not much,
if the distinction between actual and dramatic time is kept in mind.
As to (<i>b</i>), the tone of the references is surely to a summer
prolonged beyond its natural expiration for Eliza’s benefit, well
into autumn, and in such a year the fruits of autumn, which in this
country are chiefly apples, will be on the trees until October. As to
(<i>c</i>), I cannot find any evidence of the Queen’s presence at all.
Surely she is on progress elsewhere, and due to ‘return’ in the future.
I may add that Elizabeth was at Croydon in the spring of 1593, and that
it would, therefore, have been odd to defer a revival for her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_453">[453]</span> benefit
until another seven years had elapsed. The 1592 progress came to an
end upon 9 Oct. and I should put the performance not long before. When
Q<sub>1</sub> of <i>Pierce Penilesse</i> (S. R. 8 Aug. 1592) was issued, Nashe
was kept by fear of infection ‘with my Lord in the Countrey’, and the
misinterpretations of the pamphlet which he deprecates in the epistle
to Q<sub>2</sub> (McKerrow, i. 154) are hinted at in a very similar protest (l.
65) in the play.</p>

<p>The prologue is spoken by ‘the greate foole <i>Toy</i>’ (ll. 10, 1945),
who would borrow a chain and fiddle from ‘my cousin Ned’ (l. 7), also
called ‘Ned foole’ (l. 783). The epilogue is spoken (l. 1194) and
the songs sung (ll. 117, 1871) by boys. Will Summer (l. 792) gives
good advice to certain ‘deminitiue urchins’, who wait ‘on my Lords
trencher’; but he might be speaking either to actors or to boys in the
audience. The morris (l. 201) dances ‘for the credit of Wostershire’,
where Whitgift had been bishop. The prompter was Dick Huntley (l. 14),
and Vertumnus was acted by Harry Baker (l. 1567). There is a good deal
of Latin in the text. On the whole, I think that the play was given
by members of Whitgift’s household, which his biographer describes
as ‘a little academy’. The prologue (l. 33) has ‘So fares it with vs
nouices, that here betray our imperfections: we, afraid to looke on
the imaginary serpent of Enuy, paynted in mens affections, haue ceased
to tune any musike of mirth to your eares this twelue-month, thinking
that, as it is the nature of the serpent to hisse, so childhood and
ignorance would play the goslings, contemning and condemning what they
vnderstood not’. This agrees curiously in date with the termination
of the Paul’s plays. Whitgift might have entertained the Paul’s boys
during the plague and strengthened them for a performance with members
of his own household. But would they call themselves ‘nouices’?</p>

<p><i>Vide supra.</i> McKerrow, v. 10, thinks that the name of Nashe’s
alleged part may be a jest, and points out that the identification
by Fleay, ii. 124, of the play, of which nothing more is known, with
the ‘London Comedie’ of the <i>Cards</i> referred to in Harington’s
<i>Apology</i> (cf. App. C, No. xlv) is improbable.</p>



<p class="center p1"><i>The Isle of Dogs. 1597</i></p>

<p>Meres, <i>Palladis Tamia</i> (S. R. 7 Sept. 1598), writes:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘As <i>Actaeon</i> was wooried of his owne hounds: so is <i>Tom
Nash</i> of his <i>Isle of Dogs</i>. Dogges were the death
of <i>Euripedes</i>, but bee not disconsolate gallant young
<i>Iuuenall</i>, <i>Linus</i>, the sonne of <i>Apollo</i> died
the same death. Yet God forbid that so braue a witte should

barbarous <i>Getes</i>. Therefore comfort thy selfe sweete
<i>Tom</i>, with <i>Ciceros</i> glorious return to Rome, &amp; with
the counsel <i>Aeneas</i> giues to his seabeaten soldiors.’</p>
</div>

<p class="p-left p1">We learn something more from <i>Nashes Lenten Stuffe</i>
(S. R. 11 Jan. 1599), where he tells us that he is sequestered from
the wonted means of his maintenance and exposed to attacks on his
fame, through ‘the straunge turning of the Ile of Dogs from a commedie
to a tragedie two summers past, with the troublesome stir which
hapned aboute it’, and goes on to explain the ‘infortunate imperfit
Embrion of my idle houres, the Ile of Dogs before mentioned ... was
no sooner borne but I was glad to run from it’; which is what brought
him to Yarmouth. In a marginal note he adds ‘An imperfit Embrion I
may well call it, for I hauing begun but the induction and first act
of it, the other foure acts without my consent, or the least guesse
of my drift or scope, by the players were supplied, which bred both
their trouble and mine to’ (McKerrow, iii. 153). Of this there is
perhaps some confirmation in the list of writings on the cover of
the <i>Northumberland MS.</i> which records the item, not now extant
in the MS., ‘Ile of doges frmn<sup>t</sup> by Thomas Nashe inferior plaiers’.
This MS. contains work by Bacon (q.v.), and if the entry is not
itself based on <i>Lenten Stuffe</i>, it may indicate that Bacon was
professionally concerned in the proceedings to which the play gave
rise. McKerrow, v. 31, points out that the evidence is against the
suggestion in the <i>Trimming of Thomas Nashe</i> (S. R. 11 Oct. 1597)
that Nashe suffered imprisonment for the play. The Privy Council letter
of 15 Aug. 1597 (cf. App. D, No. cxi) was no doubt intended to direct
his apprehension, but, as I pointed out in <i>M. L. R.</i> iv. 410,
511, the actor and maker of plays referred to therein as actually in
prison must have been Ben Jonson, who was released by the Council on
3 Oct. 1597 (cf. App. D, No. cxii). The connexion of Jonson (q.v.)
with the <i>Isle of Dogs</i> is noted in <i>Satiromastix</i>. With
him the Council released Gabriel Spencer and Robert Shaw, and the
inference is that the peccant company was Pembroke’s (q.v.) at the
Swan on Bankside. The belief that it was the Admiral’s at the Rose
only rests on certain forged interpolations by Collier in Henslowe’s
diary. These are set out by Greg (<i>Henslowe</i>, i. xl). The only
genuine mention of the affair in the diary is the provision noted in
the memorandum of Borne’s agreement of 10 Aug. 1597 that his service is
to begin ‘imediatly after this restraynt is recaled by the lordes of
the counsell which restraynt is by the meanes of playinge the Ieylle
of Dooges’ (<i>Henslowe</i>, i. 203). The restraint was ordered by
the Privy Council on 28 July 1597 (App. D, No. cx), presumably soon
after the offence, the nature of which is only vaguely described as
the handling of ‘lewd matters’. Perhaps it is possible, at any rate
in conjecture, to be more specific. By dogs we may take it that Nashe
meant men. The idea was not new to him. In <i>Summer’s Last Will and
Testament</i> he makes Orion draw an elaborate parallel between dogs
and men, at the end of which Will Summer says that he had not thought
‘the ship of fooles would haue stayde to take in fresh water at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_455">[455]</span> the
Ile of dogges’ (l. 779). But there is nothing offensive to authority
here. Nashe returns to the question of his indiscretion in more than
one passage of <i>Lenten Stuffe</i>, and in particular has a diatribe
(McKerrow, iii. 213) against lawyers who try to fish ‘a deepe politique
state meaning’ out of what contains no such thing. ‘Talke I of a beare,
O, it is such a man that emblazons him in his armes, or of a woolfe,
a fox, or a camelion, any lording whom they do not affect it is meant
by.’ Apparently Nashe was accused of satirizing some nobleman. But
this was not the only point of attack. ‘Out steps me an infant squib
of the Innes of Court ... and he, to approue hymselfe an extrauagant
statesman, catcheth hold of a rush, and absolutely concludeth, it is
meant of the Emperor of Ruscia, and that it will vtterly marre the
traffike into that country if all the Pamphlets bee not called in and
suppressed, wherein that libelling word is mentioned.’ I do not suppose
that Nashe had literally called the Emperor of Russia a rush in <i>The
Isle of Dogs</i>, but it is quite possible that he, or Ben Jonson,
had called the King of Poland a pole. On 23 July 1597, just five days
before the trouble, a Polish ambassador had made representations in
an audience with Elizabeth, apparently about the question, vexed in
the sixteenth as in the twentieth century, of contraband in neutral
vessels, and she, scouring up her rusty old Latin for the purpose,
had answered him in very round terms. The matter, to which there are
several allusions in the Cecilian correspondence (Wright, <i>Eliz.</i>
ii. 478, 481, 485), gave some trouble, and any mention of it on the
public stage might well have been resented. A letter of Robert Beale in
1592 (McKerrow, v. 142) shows that the criticisms of Nashe’s <i>Pierce
Penilesse</i> had similarly been due to his attack upon the Danes, with
which country the diplomatic issues were much the same as with Poland.
In <i>Hatfield MSS.</i> vii. 343 is a letter of 10 Aug. 1597 to Robert
Cecil from Richard (misdescribed in the Calendar as Robert) Topcliffe,
recommending an unnamed bearer as ‘the first man that discovered to me
that seditious play called The Isle of Dogs’.</p>

sat in Parliament for London. Apparently he is distinct from the Thomas
Norton who acted from 1560 as counsel to the Stationers’ Company. He
took part in theological controversy as a Calvinist, and was opposed
to the public stage (cf. App. D, No. xxxi). In 1583 he escaped with
some difficulty from a charge of treason. His first wife, Margaret, was
daughter, and his second, Alice, niece of Cranmer.</p>

<p>Day’s epistle says that the play was ‘furniture of part of the grand
Christmasse in the Inner Temple first written about nine yeares agoe
by the right honourable Thomas now Lorde Buckherst, and by T. Norton,
and after shewed before her Maiestie, and neuer intended by the authors
therof to be published’. But one W. G. printed it in their absence,
‘getting a copie therof at some yongmans hand that lacked a litle money
and much discretion’. Machyn, 275, records on 18 Jan. 1561 ‘a play in
the quen hall at Westmynster by the gentyll-men of the Tempull, and
after a grett maske, for ther was a grett skaffold in the hall, with
grett tryhumpe as has bene sene; and the morow after the skaffold was

<p>Gascoigne names a ‘M. [Mr.] Paten’ as a contributor to the Kenilworth

<i>D. N. B.</i> as rector of Stoke Newington (but not traceable in
Hennessy) and author of an anonymous <i>Calendars of Scripture</i>
(1575). But I think he is more likely to have been Mercurius, son of
William Patten, teller of the exchequer and lord of the manor of Stoke
Newington, who matriculated at Trinity, Cambridge, in 1567 and was Blue
Mantle pursuivant in 1603 (<i>Hist. of Stoke Newington</i> in <i>Bibl.

<p class="p-left p2">GEORGE PEELE (<i>c.</i> 1557–96).</p>

<p>As the son of James Peele, clerk of Christ’s Hospital and himself
a maker of pageants (vol. i, p. 136; <i>Mediaeval Stage</i>, ii.
166), George entered the grammar school in 1565, proceeded thence
to Broadgates Hall, Oxford, in 1571, and became a student of Christ
Church in 1574, taking his B.A. in 1577 and his M.A. in 1579. In
Sept. 1579 the court of Christ’s Hospital required James Peele ‘to
discharge His howse of his sonne George Peele and all other his howsold
which have bene chargable to him’. This perhaps explains why George
prolonged his residence at Oxford until 1581. In that year he came to
London, and about the same time married. His wife’s business affairs
brought him back to Oxford in 1583 and in a deposition of 29 March he
describes himself as aged 25. During this visit he superintended the
performance before Alasco at Christ Church on 11 and 12 June of the
<i>Rivales</i> and <i>Dido</i> of William Gager, who bears testimony
to Peele’s reputation as wit and poet in two sets of Latin verses
<i>In Iphigeniam Georgii Peeli Anglicanis versibus redditam</i> (Boas,
166,180). Presumably the rest of his life was spent in London, and its
wit and accompanying riot find some record in <i>The Merry Conceited
Jests of George Peele</i> (S. R. 14 Dec. 1605: text in Bullen and in
Hazlitt, <i>Jest Books</i>, ii. 261, and Hindley, i), although this is
much contaminated with traditional matter from earlier jest books. It
provided material for the anonymous play of <i>The Puritan</i> (1607),
in which Peele appeared as George Pyeboard. His fame as a dramatist is
thus acknowledged in Nashe’s epistle to Greene’s <i>Menaphon</i> (1589):</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘For the last, though not the least of them all, I dare commend
him to all that know him, as the chief supporter of pleasance

artifex</i>; whose first increase, the Arraignment of Paris,
might plead to your opinions his pregnant dexterity of wit and
manifold variety of invention, wherein (<i>me iudice</i>) he
goeth a step beyond all that write.’</p>

It seems difficult to accept the suggestions of Sarrazin that he was
the original both of Falstaff and of Yorick. An allusion in a letter
to Edward Alleyn<span class="pagenum" id="Page_459">[459]</span> (cf. ch. xv) has unjustifiably been interpreted
as implying that Peele was actor as well as playwright, and Collier
accordingly included his name in a forged list of housekeepers at an
imaginary Blackfriars theatre of 1589 (cf. vol. ii, p. 108). He was,
however, clearly one of the three of his ‘quondam acquaintance’ to whom
Greene (q.v.) addressed the attack upon players in his <i>Groats-worth
of Wit</i> (1592). In 1596 Peele after ‘long sickness’ sent a begging
letter by his daughter to Lord Burghley, with a copy of his <i>Tale of
Troy</i>. He was buried as a ‘householder’ at St. James’s, Clerkenwell,
on 9 Nov. 1596 (<i>Harl. Soc. Registers</i>, xvii. 58), having died,
according to Meres’s <i>Palladis Tamia</i>, ‘by the pox’. He can,
therefore, hardly be the Peleus of <i>Birth of Hercules</i> (1597 &lt;).</p>

<p>Interest in Sebastian was aroused in 1589 by the expedition of Norris
and Drake to set Don Antonio on the throne of Portugal. This started on
18 April, and Peele wrote <i>A Farewell</i>, in which is a reference to
this amongst other plays (l. 20, ed. Bullen, ii. 238):</p>

<p class="p-left">There are some possible but not very clear allusions to
the Armada in the play. From 21 Feb. 1592 to 20 Jan. 1593 Strange’s men
played fourteen times for Henslowe <i>Muly Mollocco</i>, by which this
play, in which Abdelmelec is also called Muly Mollocco, is probably
meant (Greg, <i>Henslowe</i>, ii. 149). The ‘plot’ must belong to a
later revival by the Admiral’s, datable, since both Alleyn and Shaw
acted in it, either in Dec. 1597 or in 1600–2 (cf. ch. xiii).</p>

<p>The authorship has been assigned to Peele, both on stylistic evidence
and because ll. 467–72 appear over his name in R. A.’s <i>England’s
Parnassus</i> (1600), but R. A. has an error in at least one of his
ascriptions to Peele, and he ascribes l. 49 of this play to Dekker

<p>Fleay, ii. 157, makes the date 1590–1, on the ground that lines are
quoted from <i>Polyhymnia</i> (1590). A theory that Shakespeare acted
in the play is founded on ll. 759–62, where after Baliol’s coronation
Elinor says:</p>

was played fourteen times by the Admiral’s, from 29 Aug. 1595 to 14

revision, can hardly be Peele’s play. ‘Longe-shanckes sewte’ is in

three ‘discourses’. It had choruses, of which two only are preserved.
One is ll. 572–95 (at end of sc. iv of <i>M. S. R.</i> ed.). The other
(ll. 1646–58; <i>M. S. R.</i> sc. xv) headed ‘Chorus 5’, contains the

Mahemetes head’. The Admiral’s had played <i>Mahomet</i> for Henslowe
from 16 Aug. 1594 to 5 Feb. 1595, and a play called <i>The Love of a
Grecian Lady</i> or <i>The Grecian Comedy</i> from 5 Oct. 1594 to 10
Oct. 1595. In Aug. 1601 Henslowe bought <i>Mahemett</i> from Alleyn,
and incurred other expenses on the play for the Admiral’s (Henslowe,
ii. 167; <i>Henslowe Papers</i>, 116). Possibly all the three titles of
1594–5 stand for Peele’s play. Jacob Ayrer wrote a play on the siege of
Constantinople and the loves of Mahomet and Irene. This may have had
some relation on the one hand to Peele’s, and on the other to a play of
the siege of Constantinople used by Spencer (cf. ch. xiv) in Germany
during 1612–14 (Herz, 73). Pistol’s ‘Have we not Hiren here?’ (<i>2
Hen. IV</i>, <span class="allsmcap">II.</span> iv. 173) is doubtless from the play.</p>

237); G. F. Reynolds, <i>W. P. and his Plays</i> (1914, <i>M. P.</i>
xii. 241).</p>

<p>Percy’s authorship appears to be fixed by a correspondence between an
epigram in the MS. to Charles Fitzgeffrey with one <i>Ad Gulielmum
Percium</i> in <i>Fitzgeoffridi Affaniae</i> (1601), sig. D 2. 6.</p>

<p><i>The Cuck-Queanes and Cuckolds Errants</i> is dated 1601 and
<i>The Faery Pastorall</i> 1603. The other plays are unprinted and
practically unknown, although Reynolds gives some account of <i>The
Aphrodysial.</i> There are elaborate stage-directions, which contain
several references to Paul’s, for which the plays, whether in fact
acted or not, were evidently intended, as is shown by an author’s note
appended to the manuscript (cf. ch. xii, s.v. Paul’s).</p>

<p>I feel some doubt as to the original date of these plays. It seems
to me just conceivable that they were originally produced by the
Paul’s boys before 1590, and revised by Percy after 1599 in hopes of a
revival. Some of the s.ds. are descriptive in the past tense (cf.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_465">[465]</span> ch.
xxii), which suggests actual production. The action of <i>C. and C.
Errant</i> is during the time of the Armada, but the composition must
be later than the death of Tarlton, as his ghost prologizes. Here the
author notes, ‘Rather to be omitted if for Powles, and another Prologue
for him to be brought in Place’. <i>Faery Pastoral</i> uses (p. 97) the
date ‘1647’; it is in fairy time, but points to some revision when the
MS. was written. There are alternative final scenes, with the note, ‘Be
this the foresayd for Powles, For Actors see the Direction at later end
of this Pastorall, which is separate by itself, Extra Olens, as they
say’. Similarly in <i>Aphrodysial</i> a direction for beards is noted
‘Thus for Actors; for Powles without’, and another s.d. is ‘Chambers
(noise supposd for Powles) For Actors’. A reference to ‘a showre of
Rose-water and confits, as was acted in Christ Church in Oxford, in
Dido and Aeneas’ is a reminiscence of Gager’s play of 12 June 1583, and
again makes a seventeenth-century date seem odd.</p>


<p class="p-left p2">PETER (?) PETT (<i>c.</i> 1600).</p>

<p>Henslowe’s diary records a payment of £6 on 17 May 1600 for the
Admiral’s ‘to pay Will: Haulton [Haughton] and Mr. Pett in full payment
of a play called straunge newes out of Poland’. Fleay, i. 273, says:
‘Pett is not heard of elsewhere. Should it not be Chett., <i>i.e.</i>
Chettle? The only Pett I know of as a writer is Peter Pett, who
published <i>Time’s journey to seek his daughter Truth</i>, in verse,
1599.’ To which Greg, <i>Henslowe</i>, ii. 213, replies: ‘Henslowe
often has Cett for Chettle, which is even nearer, but only where he is
crowded for room and he never applies to him the title of Mr.’</p>

1566 and 1591. I do not know whether he may be the ‘Phelypes’, who was
apparently concerned with John Heywood and a play by Paul’s (q.v.)
in 1559. A John Phillipps, this or another, is mentioned (1619) as a

<p class="p-left p2">HENRY PORTER (<i>c.</i> 1596–9).</p>

<p>Porter first appears in Henslowe’s diary as recipient of a payment of
£5 on 16 Dec. 1596 and a loan of £4 on 7 March 1597, both on account of
the Admiral’s. It may be assumed that he was already writing for the
company, who purchased five plays, wholly or partly by him, between
May 1598 and March 1599. Meres, in his <i>Palladis Tamia</i> of 1598,
counts him as one of ‘the best for Comedy amongst vs’. He appears to
have been in needy circumstances, and borrowed several small sums
from the company or from Henslowe personally (Greg, <i>Henslowe</i>,
ii. 304). On 28 Feb. 1599, when he obtained £2 on account of <i>Two
Merry Women of Abingdon</i>, ‘he gaue me his faythfulle promysse that
I shold haue alle the boockes w<sup>ch</sup> he writte ether him sellfe or
w<sup>th</sup> any other’. On 16 April 1599, in consideration of 1<i>s.</i>
he bound himself in £10 to pay Henslowe a debt of 25<i>s.</i> on
the following day, but could not meet his obligation. Porter is not
traceable as a dramatist after 1599. His extant play, on the title-page
of which he is described as ‘Gent.’, suggests a familiarity with the
neighbourhood of Oxford, and I see no <i>a priori</i> reason why
he should not be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_467">[467]</span> the Henry Porter, son of a London gentleman, who
matriculated from Brasenose on 19 June 1589 (Boase and Clark, ii. 2,
170), or the Henricus Porter, apparently a musician, of John Weever’s
<i>Epigrammes</i> (1599), v. 24, or the Henry Porter of Christ Church
who became B.Mus. in July 1600 (Wood, <i>Fasti Oxon.</i> i. 284), or
the Henry Porter who was a royal sackbut on 21 June 1603 (Nagel, 36),
or the Henry Porter whose son Walter became Gentleman of the Chapel
Royal on 5 Jan. 1616 and has left musical works (<i>D. N. B.</i>).
Gayley’s argument to the contrary rests on the unfounded assumption
that the musician could not have been writing Bankside plays during the
progress of his studies for his musical degree.</p>

<p>The play shows no signs of being a sequel, and is presumably the
First Part, to which Porter wrote a Second Part (<i>vide infra</i>)
in the winter of 1598–9. It was an Admiral’s play, and therefore one
would expect to find it in Henslowe’s very full, if not absolutely
exhaustive, chronicle of the company’s repertory. Of the plays named as
his by Henslowe, <i>Love Prevented</i> seems the only likely title. But
he was in the pay of the company before the diary began to record the
authorship of plays, and Part i may therefore be among the anonymous
plays of 1596–7 or an earlier season. Gayley suggests <i>The Comedy
of Humours</i>, produced 11 May 1597, but that is more plausibly
identified with Chapman’s <i>Humorous Day’s Mirth</i> (q.v.). Another
possibility is <i>Woman Hard to Please</i>, produced 27 Jan. 1597.</p>

<p class="p-left p2">THOMAS POUND (1538?-1616?).</p>

<p>Pound was of Beaumonds in Farlington, Hants, the son of William Pound
and Anne Wriothesley, daughter of Thomas, first Earl of Southampton.
William Pound had a brother Anthony, whose daughter Honora married
Henry, fourth Earl of Sussex (<i>V. H. Hants</i>, iii. 149; <i>Harl.
Soc.</i> lxiv. 138; Berry, <i>Hants Genealogies</i>, 194; <i>Recusant
Rolls</i> in <i>Catholic Record Soc.</i> xviii. 278, 279, 330, 334).
Thomas was in youth a Winchester boy, a Lincoln’s Inn lawyer, and a
courtier of repute. About 1570 he left the world and became a fervent
Catholic, and the record of his recusancy, of his relations with the
Jesuit order, which he probably joined, of the help he gave to Edmund
Campion, and of his long life of imprisonment and domiciliary restraint
is written in H. Morus, <i>Historia Missionis Anglicanae Societatis
Jesu</i> (1660); D. Bartoli, <i>Dell’ Istoria della Compagnia di
Gesu: L’Inghilterra</i> (1667); N. Sanders and E. Rishton, <i>De
Origine Schismatis Anglicani</i> (1586); M. Tanner, <i>Societas Jesu
Apostolorum Imitatrix</i> (1694); R. Simpson in <i>2 Rambler</i>
(1857), viii. 29, 94; H. Foley, <i>Records of the English Province of
the Society of Jesus</i>, iii (1878), 567; J. H. Pollen, <i>English
Catholics in the Reign of Elizabeth</i> (1920), 333 <i>sqq.</i> I am
only concerned with his worldly life and his quitting of it. As a
Winchester <i>alumnus</i>, he is said to have delivered a Latin speech
of welcome to Elizabeth (Bartoli, 51), presumably at her visit of 1560
(App. A), but he can hardly still have been a schoolboy; perhaps he
was at New College. He had already been entered at Lincoln’s Inn on 16
Feb. 1560 (<i>Adm. Reg.</i> i. 66), and it was on behalf of Lincoln’s
Inn that he wrote and pronounced two mask orations which are preserved
in <i>Bodl. Rawl. Poet. MS.</i> 108, ff. 24, 29, whence they are
described in E. Brydges, <i>British Bibliographer</i>, ii. 612. Both
seem to have been before Elizabeth (cf. vol. i, p. 162, and App. A).
The first, at the wedding of his cousin Henry, Earl of Southampton,
in Feb. 1566, is headed in the manuscript ‘The copye of an oration
made and pronounced by Mr. Pownde of Lyncolnes Inne, with a brave
maske out of the same howse, all one greatte horses att the mariage
off the yonge erle of South hampton to the Lord Mountagues dawghter
abowt Shrouetyde 1565’. The second, at the wedding on 1 July 1566 of
another cousin, Frances Radcliffe, is similarly headed ‘The copye of
an oration made and pronounced by Mr. Pownd of Lincolnes Inne, with a
maske att y<sup>e</sup> marriage of y<sup>e</sup> Earl of Sussex syster to Mr. Myldmaye
off Lyncolnes Inne 1566’. From this, which is in rhyming quatrains,
Brydges quotes 119 lines; they are of no merit. In 1580 Pound wrote
from his prison at Bishop’s Stortford to Sir Christopher Hatton (<i>S.
P. D. Eliz.</i> cxlii. 20) commending a petition to the Queen, ‘for her
poeticall presents sake, which her Majesty disdayned not to take at
poore Mercuries hands, if you remember it, at Killiegeworth Castle’.
The reference must be to the Kenilworth visit of 1568, rather than 1573
or 1575, for soon after Thomas Pound’s days of courtly masking came to
an abrupt end. The story is told in Morus, 46:</p>

<p>‘Natales Christi dies, ut semper solemnes, ita anno sexagesimo quarto
fuere celeberrimi; dabantur in Curia ludi apparatissimi Thoma<span class="pagenum" id="Page_469">[469]</span> Pondo
instructore. Inter saltandum, nudam eius manum manu nuda prensat
Regina, tum ei caput, abrepto Leicestrie Comitis pileo, ipsa tegit, ne
ex vehementi motu accensus subito refrigeraretur. Imposita ei videbatur
laurea: cum (secundo eandem saltationis formam flagitante Regina)
celerrime de more uno in pede circumuolitans, pronus concidit; Plausu
in risum mutato, surge, inquit Regina, Domine Taure; ea voce commotus,
surrexit quidem; at flexo ad terram poplite, vulgatum illud latine
prolocutus, <i>sic transit gloria mundi</i>, proripuit se, et non longo
interuallo Aulam spesque fallaces deseruit, consumptarum facultatum et
violatae Religionis praemium ludibrium consecutus.’</p>

<p>There is a little difficulty as to the date. Morus puts it in 1564,
but goes on to add that Pound was in his thirtieth year, and he was
certainly born in 1538 or 1539. And Bartoli, 51, followed by Tanner,
480, gives 1569, citing, probably from Jesuit archives, a letter
written by Pound himself on 3 June 1609. No doubt 1569, which may mean
either 1568–9 or 1569–70, is right.</p>


<p class="p-left p2">THOMAS PRESTON (&gt; 1569–1589 &lt;).</p>

<p>A Thomas Preston entered King’s, Cambridge, from Eton in 1553, and
became Fellow in 1556, taking his B.A. in 1557 and his M.A. in 1561.
At Elizabeth’s visit in 1564 he disputed with Thomas Cartwright before
her in the Philosophy Act, and also played in <i>Dido</i>, winning such
favour that she called him her ‘scholar’ and gave him a pension of £20
a year from the privy purse (Cunningham, xx; Nichols, <i>Eliz.</i>
i. 270; Fuller, <i>Cambridge</i>, 137; Wordsworth, <i>Ecclesiastical
Memorials</i>, iv. 322). He held his fellowship at King’s until 1581.
In 1583 a newswriter reported him to be ‘withdrawen into Scotland as a
malcontent and there made much of by the King’ (Wright, <i>Eliz.</i>
ii. 215). In 1584 he became Master of Trinity Hall, and in 1589 was
Vice-Chancellor. In 1592, with other Heads of Houses, he signed a
memorial to Burghley in favour of the stay of plays at Cambridge (<i>M.
S. C.</i> i. 192). It seems to me incredible that he should, as is
usually taken for granted, have been the author of <i>Cambyses</i>,
about which there is nothing academic, and I think that there must
have been a popular writer of the same name, responsible for the
play, and also for certain ballads of the broadside type, of which
<i>A Lamentation from Rome</i> (Collier, <i>Old Ballads</i>, <i>Percy
Soc.</i>) was printed in 1570, and <i>A Ballad from the Countrie,
sent to showe how we should Fast this Lent</i> (<i>Archiv</i>, cxiv.
329, from <i>Bodl. Rawl. Poet. MS.</i> 185) is dated 1589. Both are
subscribed, like <i>Cambyses</i>, ‘Finis Quod Thomas Preston’. A third
was entered on S. R. in 1569–70 as ‘A geliflower of swete marygolde,
wherein the frutes of tyranny you may beholde’.</p>

<p>A Thomas Preston is traceable as a quarterly waiter at Court under
Edward VI (<i>Trevelyan Papers</i>, i. 195, 200, 204; ii. 19, 26, 33),
and a choirmaster of the same name was ejected from Windsor Chapel as a
recusant about 1561 (cf. ch. xii).</p>

<p>Line 1148 mentions Bishop Bonner whose ‘delight was to shed blood’, and
Fleay, 64, therefore dates the play 1569–70, as Bonner died 5 Sept.
1569. But he may merely be put in the past as an ex-bishop. Three comic
villains, Huf, Ruf, and Snuf, are among the characters, and chronology
makes it possible that the play was the <i>Huff, Suff, and Ruff</i>
(cf. App. A) played at Court during Christmas 1560–1. Preston may,
however, have borrowed these characters, as Ulpian Fulwell borrowed
Ralph Roister, from an earlier play.</p>

<p>The author of <i>The Arte of English Poesie</i> (1589; cf. App. C,
No. xli) claims to have written three plays, no one of which is
extant. He analyses at length the plot of his ‘Comedie entituled
<i>Ginecocratia</i>’ (Arber, 146), in which were a King, Polemon,
Polemon’s daughter, and Philino. He twice cites his ‘enterlude’,
<i>Lustie London</i> (Arber, 183, 208), in which were a Serjeant, his
Yeoman, a Carrier, and a Buffoon. And he twice cites his ‘enterlude’,
<i>The Woer</i> (Arber, 212, 233), in which were a Country Clown, a
Young Maid of the City, and a Nurse.</p>

<p>The author of <i>The Arte</i> is referred to by Camden in 1614 (cf.
Gregory Smith, ii. 444) as ‘Maister Puttenham’, and by E. Bolton,
<i>Hypercritica</i> (<i>c.</i> 1618), with the qualification ‘as the
Fame is’, as ‘one of her Gentlemen Pensioners, Puttenham’. H. Crofts,
in his edition (1880) of Sir Thomas Elyot’s <i>The Governour</i>, has
shown that this is more likely to have been Richard, the elder, than
George, the younger, son of Robert Puttenham and nephew of Sir Thomas
Elyot. Neither brother, however, can be shown to have been a Gentleman
Pensioner, and Collier gives no authority for his statement that
Richard was a Yeoman of the Guard. Richard was writing as far back as
the reign of Henry VIII, and the dates of his plays are unknown.</p>

<p>The moralist who published <i>A Mirrour of Monsters</i> (1587), <i>The

of the attack on plays (cf. App. C, No. xxxviii) in the first of
these, probably identical with the dramatist who received payment from
Henslowe on behalf of the Admiral’s for the following plays during
1598–1601:</p>

<p class="p-left ph">(i) <i>Mulmutius Dunwallow.</i></p>

agayne’ (<i>Henslowe Papers</i>, 56).</p>

<p>Rankins has also been suggested as the author of <i>Leire</i> (cf. ch.
xxiv).</p>


<p class="p-left p2">THOMAS RICHARDS (<i>c.</i> 1577).</p>

<p>A miscellaneous writer (<i>D. N. B.</i>) who described the visit of the

(McKerrow, 229).</p>

<p>A contributor to the Bristol Entertainment of Elizabeth (cf. ch. xxiv,

<p>Henslowe paid £3 on behalf of the Admiral’s men on 9 Sept. 1602 ‘vnto
M<sup>r</sup>. Robensone for a tragedie called Felmelanco’. Later in the month he
paid two sums amounting to another £3 to Chettle, for ‘his tragedie’ of
the same name. The natural interpretation is that Chettle and Robinson
co-operated, but Fleay, i. 70, rather wantonly says, ‘Robinson was,
I think, to Chettle what Mrs. Harris was to Mrs. Gamp’, and Greg,
<i>Henslowe</i>, ii. 224, while not agreeing with Fleay, ‘It is,
however, unlikely that he had any hand in the play. Probably Chettle
had again pawned his MS.’</p>

<p>Dates make it improbable that this Robinson was the poet Richard
Robinson whose lost ‘tragedy’ <i>Hemidos and Thelay</i> is not likely
to have been a play (cf. App. M).</p>

<p>H. D. Sykes, <i>The Authorship of The Taming of A Shrew, etc.</i>
(1920, <i>Sh. Association</i>), argues, on the basis of a comparison of
phraseology with <i>When You See Me, You Know Me</i> and some of the
additions to <i>Dr. Faustus</i>, for Rowley’s authorship of (<i>a</i>)
<i>The Famous Victories</i>, (<i>b</i>) the prose scenes of <i>A
Shrew</i>, (<i>c</i>) the clowning passages in Greene’s <i>Orlando
Furioso</i>, (<i>d</i>) the prose scenes of <i>Wily Beguiled</i>. He
suggests that the same collaborator, borrowing first from Marlowe
and then from Kyd, may have supplied the verse scenes both of <i>A
Shrew</i> and of <i>Wily Beguiled</i>. There is no external evidence to
connect Rowley with the Queen’s, and he only becomes clearly traceable
with the Admiral’s in 1598, but Mr. Sykes has certainly made out a
stylistic case which deserves consideration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_473">[473]</span></p>


<p class="p-left p2">WILLIAM ROWLEY (?-1625 &lt;).</p>

<p>Of Rowley’s origin and birth nothing is known. He first appears as
collaborator in a play of Queen Anne’s men in 1607, and, although
he may have also acted with this company, there is no evidence of
the fact. His name is in the patent of 30 March 1610 for the Duke
of York’s men with that of Thomas Hobbes, to whom his pamphlet <i>A
Search for Money</i> (1609, <i>Percy Soc. ii</i>.) is dedicated. He
acted as their payee from 1610 to 1615, and they played his <i>Hymen’s
Holiday or Cupid’s Vagaries</i>, now lost, in 1612. <i>A Knave in
Print</i> and <i>The Fool without Book</i>, entered as his on 9 Sept.
1653 (Eyre, i. 428), might be their anonymous two-part <i>Knaves</i>
of 1613. He contributed an epitaph on Thomas Greene of the Queen’s to
Cooke’s <i>Greene’s Tu Quoque</i> (1614). From 1615 to March 1616 the
Prince’s men seem to have been merged in the Princess Elizabeth’s.
They then resumed their identity at the Hope, and with them Rowley is
traceable as an actor to 1619 and as a writer, in collaboration with
Thomas Middleton (q.v.), Thomas Ford, and Thomas Heywood, until 1621.
In 1621 he wrote an epitaph upon one of their members, Hugh Attwell,
apparently as his ‘fellow’. It was still as a Prince’s man that he
received mourning for James on 17 March 1625. But in 1621 and 1622 he
was writing, with Middleton and alone, for the Lady Elizabeth’s at
the Cockpit, and in 1623 both writing and acting in <i>The Maid of
the Mill</i> for the King’s men, and prefixing verses to Webster’s
<i>Duchess of Malfi</i>, which belonged to the same company. He had
definitely joined the King’s by 24 June 1625 when his name appears in
their new patent, and for them his latest play-writing was done. In
addition to what was published under his name, he is generally credited
with some share in the miscellaneous collection of the Beaumont and
Fletcher Ff. His name is not in an official list of King’s men in
1629, but the date of his death is unknown. A William Rowley married
Isabel Tooley at Cripplegate in 1637, but the date hardly justifies the
assumption that it was the dramatist.</p>

<p>The epistle says that the play was still often acted, and ‘as Plaies
were then, some twenty yeares agone, it was in the fashion’. This
dating and the mention of the Red Bull justify us in regarding it as an
early play for Queen Anne’s men.</p>

<p>Fleay, 203 and ii. 95, treats the play, without discussion, as written
by Middleton and Rowley for the Queen’s Revels <i>c.</i> 1607.
Bullen, <i>Middleton</i>, i. lxxxix, and Stork, 17, concur as to the
date, the former regarding it as Middleton’s revised <i>c.</i> 1622
by Rowley, the latter as practically all Rowley’s. These views are
evidently influenced by the mention of the Children of the Revels on
the title-page. Wiggin, 7, noting allusions to the battle of Prague
in 1620 and <i>Reynard the Fox</i> (1621), thinks it alternatively
possible that Rowley wrote it under Middletonian influence for one of
the later Revels companies <i>c.</i> 1622. There was no doubt a company
of Children of the Revels in 1622–3 (Murray, i. 198), but the name on
a t.p. of 1633 would naturally refer to the still later company of
1629–37 (Murray, i. 279).</p>

<p>Kirkman’s attribution to Shakespeare and Rowley was first made
in his play-list of 1661 (Greg, <i>Masques</i>, liii). It is
generally accepted for Rowley, but not for Shakespeare. But Fleay,
<i>Shakespeare</i>, 289,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_475">[475]</span> on a hint of P. A. Daniel, gave Rowley a
collaborator in Middleton, and later (ii. 105) treated the play as
a revision by Rowley of the <i>Uther Pendragon</i> produced by the
Admiral’s on 29 April 1597. This view seems to rest in part upon
the analogous character of <i>The Mayor of Quinborough</i>. Howe
thinks that Rowley worked up a sketch by Middleton later than 1621,
and attempts a division of the play on this hypothesis. But Stork,
<i>Rowley</i>, 58, thinks that Rowley revised <i>Uther Pendragon</i>
or some other old play about 1608. F. W. Moorman (<i>C. H.</i> v. 249)
suggests Dekker, and Wells Beaumont and Fletcher.</p>

<p>Chamberlain, describing to Carleton James’s visit to Cambridge in
March 1615, wrote (Birch, i. 304): ‘The second night [8 March] was a
comedy of Clare Hall, with the help of two or three good actors from
other houses, wherein David Drummond, on a hobby-horse, and Brakin, the
recorder of the town, under the name of Ignoramus, a common lawyer,
bore great parts. The thing was full of mirth and variety, with many
excellent actors; among whom the Lord Compton’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_476">[476]</span> son, though least,
yet was not worst, but more than half marred by extreme length.’
On 31 March he told Carleton (Birch, i. 360) of the Oxford satires
on the play, and of a possible second visit by the King, unless he
could persuade the actors to visit London. And on 20 May he wrote to
him (Birch, i. 363): ‘On Saturday last [13 May], the King went again
to Cambridge, to see the play “Ignoramus”, which has so nettled the
lawyers, that they are almost out of all patience.’ He adds that rhymes
and ballads had been written by the lawyers, and answered. Specimens
of the ‘flytings’ to which the play gave rise are in Hawkins, xxxvii,
xlii, cvii, 259. Fuller, <i>Church History</i> (1655), x. 70, reports
a story that the irritation caused to the lawyers also led to John
Selden’s demonstration of the secular origin of tithes. The authorship
of <i>Ignoramus</i> is indicated by the entry in a notice of the royal
visit printed (Hawkins, xxx) from a manuscript in the library of Sir
Edward Dering:</p>

<p class="p-left"><i>Ignoramus</i> was largely based on the
<i>Trappolaria</i> (1596) of Giambattista Porta, into which Ruggle
introduced his satire of the Cambridge recorder, Francis Brackyn, who
had already been the butt of <i>3 Parnassus</i>.</p>

<p>Of the translators, Jasper Heywood (1535–98) became Fellow of All
Souls, Oxford, in 1558. He was son of John Heywood the dramatist, and
uncle of John Donne. In 1562 he became a Jesuit, and left England,
to return as a missionary in 1581. He was imprisoned during 1583–5
and then expelled. John Studley (<i>c.</i> 1547–?) entered Trinity,
Cambridge, in 1563 and became Fellow in 1567. Alexander Neville
(1544–1614) took his B.A. in 1560 at Cambridge. He became secretary
successively to Parker, Grindal, and Whitgift, archbishops of
Canterbury, and produced other literary work, chiefly in Latin. Thomas
Nuce (<i>ob.</i> 1617) was Fellow of Pembroke Hall, Cambridge, in 1562,
and became Canon of Ely in 1585. Thomas Newton (<i>c.</i> 1542–1607)
migrated in 1562 from Trinity, Oxford, to Queens’, Cambridge, but
apparently returned to his original college later. About 1583 he became
Rector of Little Ilford, Essex. He produced much unimportant verse and
prose, in Latin and English, and was a friend of William Hunnis (q.v.).</p>

<p>For a fragment of another translation of <i>Hercules Oetaeus</i>, cf.
s.v. Elizabeth. Archer’s play-list of 1656 contains the curious entry
‘Baggs Seneca’, described as a tragedy. Of this Greg, <i>Masques</i>,
li, can make nothing.</p>


<p class="p-left p2">WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE (1564–1616).</p>

<p>No adequate treatment of Shakespeare’s life and plays is possible
within the limits of this chapter. I have therefore contented myself
with giving the main bibliographical data, in illustration of the
chapters on the companies (Strange’s, Pembroke’s, Chamberlain’s, and
King’s) and the theatres (Rose, Newington Butts, Theatre, Curtain,
Globe, Blackfriars) with which he was or may have been concerned. I
follow the conjectural chronological order adopted in my article on
Shakespeare in the 11th ed. of the <i>Encyclopaedia Britannica</i>.</p>



<p class="center p1"><i>Collections</i></p>

<p>[1619]. It is probable that the 1619 editions of <i>Merry Wives of
Windsor</i> (Q<sub>2</sub>), <i>Pericles</i> (Q<sub>4</sub>), and the apocryphal
<i>Yorkshire Tragedy</i> were intended to form part of a collection
of plays ascribed to Shakespeare, and that the ‘1600’ editions of
<i>Midsummer Night’s Dream</i> (Q<sub>2</sub>) and <i>Merchant of Venice</i>
(Q<sub>2</sub>) bearing the name of the printer Roberts, the ‘1600’ edition
of the apocryphal <i>Sir John Oldcastle</i> bearing the initials
T. P., the ‘1608’ edition of <i>Henry V</i> (Q<sub>3</sub>), the ‘1608’
edition of <i>King Lear</i> (Q<sub>2</sub>) lacking the name of the ‘Pide
Bull’ shop, and the undated edition of <i>The Whole Contention of
York and Lancaster</i> were all also printed in 1619 for the same
purpose. The printer seems to have been William Jaggard, with whom was
associated Thomas Pavier, who held the copyright of several of the
plays. Presumably an intention to prefix a general title-page is the
explanation of the shortened imprints characteristic of these editions.
The sheets of <i>The Whole Contention</i> and <i>Pericles</i> have in
fact continuous signatures; but the plan seems to have been modified,
and the other plays issued separately. The bibliographical evidence
bearing on this theory is discussed by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_480">[480]</span> W. W. Greg, W. Jaggard, A. W.
Pollard, and A. H. Huth in <i>2 Library</i>, ix. 113, 381; x. 208; and
<i>3 Library</i>, i. 36, 46; ii. 101; and summed up by A. W. Pollard,
<i>Shakespeare Folios and Quartos</i>, 81. Confirmatory evidence is
adduced by W. J. Niedig, <i>The Shakespeare Quartos of 1619</i> (<i>M.
P.</i> viii. 145) and <i>False Dates on Shakespeare Quartos</i> (1910,
<i>Century</i>, 912).</p>

<p><i>Cardenio</i> is presumably the play given as ‘Cardenno’ and
‘Cardenna’ by the King’s men at Court in 1612–13 and again on 8 June
1613 (App. B). Its theme, from <i>Don Quixote</i>, Part I, chh.
xxiii-xxxvii, is that of <i>Double Falsehood, or the Distressed
Lovers</i>, published in 1728 by Lewis Theobald as ‘written originally
by W. Shakespeare, and now revised and adapted to the stage by M<sup>r</sup>.
Theobald’. In 1727 it had been produced at Drury Lane. Theobald claimed
to have three manuscripts, no one of which is now known. One had
formerly, he said, belonged to Betterton, and was in the handwriting
of ‘M<sup>r</sup>. <i>Downes</i>, the famous Old Prompter’ (cf. App. I). Another
came from a ‘Noble Person’, with a tradition ‘that it was given by
our Author, as a Present of Value, to a Natural Daughter of his,

Stage’. Theobald is much under suspicion of having written <i>Double
Falsehood</i> himself (cf. T. R. Lounsbury, <i>The First Editors of

<p class="p-left p2">EDWARD SHARPHAM (1576–1608).</p>

<p>Edward was the third son of Richard Sharpham of Colehanger in East
Allington, Devonshire, where he was baptized on 22 July 1576. He
entered the Middle Temple on 9 Oct. 1594. He made his will on 22
Apr. 1608, and was buried on the following day at St. Margaret’s,
Westminster. It may be inferred that he died of plague. Unless he is
the E. S. who wrote <i>The Discoveries of the Knights of the Post</i>
(1597), he is only known by his two plays. There is no justification
for identifying him with the Ed. Sharphell who prefixed a sonnet to
the <i>Humours Heav’n on Earth</i> (1605) of John Davies of Hereford,
calling Davies his ‘beloued Master’, or, consequently, for assuming
that he had been a pupil of Davies as writing-master at Magdalen,
Oxford.</p>

<p><i>Edition</i> by H. Nibbe (1912, <i>Materialien</i>, xxxvi).</p>

<p>The epistle says that the book has been ‘long lookt for’, that the
author is ‘ith’ Country’ and that further ‘Comicall discourses’ from
him are forthcoming. A date after the executions for treason on 30 Jan.
1606 is suggested, as in the case of Marston’s <i>Fawn</i>, by ii. 364,
‘I have heard say, they will rise sooner, and goe with more deuotion to
see an extraordinarie execution, then to heare a Sermon’, and with this
indication allusions to the Union (ii. 258) and <i>Northward Ho!</i>
(ii. 397) and resemblances to the <i>Fawn</i> are consistent.</p>

<p>Baker, <i>Biographia Dramatica</i>, ii. 146, cites Coxeter as authority
for a false ascription of the play to Shakespeare. But nobody could
well have supposed Shakespeare to be indicated by the initials E.
S., for which there is really no other candidate than Sharpham. The
play must be the further ‘Comicall discourses’ promised by the same
publishers in the epistle to <i>The Fleir</i>, and it may be added that
Hayman (cf. <i>D. N. B.</i>), like Sharpham, was a Devonshire man. The
date may be taken to be 1607, as the King’s Revels are not traceable
earlier.</p>


<p class="p-left p2">SAMUEL SHEPPARD (&gt; 1606–1652 &lt;).</p>

<p>The known work of this miscellaneous writer belongs to 1646–52, and
although it includes a political tract in dramatic form, it is only
his vague claim of a share, possibly as amanuensis, in Jonson’s
<i>Sejanus</i> (q.v.), which suggests that he might be the unknown S.
S. whose initials are on the title-page of <i>The Honest Lawyer</i>
(1616).</p>


<p class="p-left p2">SIR PHILIP SIDNEY (1554–86).</p>

<p><i>Editions</i> in Nichols, <i>Elizabeth<sup>1, 2</sup></i>, ii. 94
(1788–1823), and Collections of Sidney’s <i>Works</i>.</p>

<p>The entertainment was in the Garden. As the Queen entered the grove,
An Honest Man’s Wife of the Country delivered a speech and a written
supplication in verse, for decision of the case of her daughter. Then
came the daughter, chosen May Lady, and haled this way by six Shepherds
on behalf of her lover Espilus and six Foresters on behalf of her
lover Therion. The case was put to the Queen by Laius an old Shepherd,
Rombus a Schoolmaster, and finally the May Lady herself. Espilus,
accompanied by the Shepherds with recorders, and Therion, accompanied
by the Foresters with cornets, sang in rivalry. A ‘contention’ followed
between Dorcas, an old Shepherd, and Rixus, a young Forester, ‘whether
of their fellows had sung better, and whether the estate of shepherds
or foresters were the more worshipful’. Rombus tried to intervene. The
May Lady appealed to the Queen, who decided for Espilus. Shepherds and
Foresters made a consort together, Espilus sang a song, and the May
Lady took her leave.</p>

<p>Nichols assigns the entertainment to Elizabeth’s Wanstead visit of
1578. But it might also belong to that of 1579, and possibly to that
of 1582. In 1579, but not in 1578, the visit covered May Day. The
references in the text are, however, to the month of May, rather than
to May Day.</p>



<p class="center p1"><i>Pastoral Dialogue, c. 1580</i></p>

Wilton. [Appended to <i>Arcadia</i>; cf. <i>supra</i>.]</p>

<p><i>Edition</i> in A. B. Grosart, <i>Poems of Sidney</i> (1877), ii. 50.</p>

<p>This dialogue between Dick and Will appears to belong to the series of
poems motived by Sidney’s love for Penelope Devereux. It must therefore
date between August 1577, when Sidney first visited his sister, Lady
Pembroke, at Wilton, and his own marriage on 20 Sept. 1583. There is no
indication that the Queen was present; not improbably the ‘Show’ took
place while Sidney was out of favour at Court, and was living at Wilton
from March to August 1580.</p>


<p class="p-left p2">JOHN SINGER (?-1603 &lt;).</p>

<p>On Singer’s career as an actor, see ch. xv.</p>

<p>On 13 Jan. 1603, about which date he apparently retired from the
Admiral’s, Henslowe paid him £5 ‘for his playe called Syngers
vallentarey’ (Greg, <i>Henslowe</i>, i. 173; ii. 226). I think the term
‘vallentarey’ must be used by Henslowe, rightly or wrongly, in the
sense of ‘valedictory’. <i>Quips on Questions</i> (1600), a book of
‘themes’, is not his, but Armin’s (q.v.).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_493">[493]</span></p>


<p class="p-left p2">WILLIAM SLY (?-1608).</p>

<p>On Sly’s career as an actor, see ch. xv.</p>

<p>He has been guessed at as the author of <i>Thomas Lord Cromwell</i>
(cf. ch. xxiv).</p>


<p class="p-left p2">W. SMITH.</p>

<p>There are traceable (<i>a</i>) Wentworth Smith, who wrote plays for
Henslowe’s companies, the Admiral’s, and Worcester’s during 1601–3
(<i>vide infra</i>) and witnessed the will of W. Haughton in 1605;
(<i>b</i>) a W. Smith, who wrote <i>Hector of Germany</i> and <i>The
Freeman’s Honour</i> (<i>vide infra</i>); (<i>c</i>) a ‘Smith’, whose
<i>Fair Foul One</i> Herbert licensed on 28 Nov. 1623 (Chalmers, <i>S.
A.</i> 216; Herbert, 26); (<i>d</i>) if Warburton can be trusted, a
‘Will. Smithe’, whose <i>S<sup>t</sup> George for England</i> his cook burnt
(<i>3 Library</i>, ii. 231). It is possible that (<i>a</i>) and
(<i>b</i>) may be identical. A long space of time separates (<i>b</i>)
and (<i>c</i>), and if (<i>d</i>) is to be identified with any other,
it may most plausibly be with (<i>c</i>). There is nothing to connect
any one of them with the William Smith who published sonnets under
the title of <i>Chloris</i> (1596), or with any other member of this
infernal family, and the ‘W. S.’ of the anonymous <i>Locrine</i>
(1595), <i>Thomas Lord Cromwell</i> (1602), <i>The Puritan</i> (1607)
is more probably, in each case, aimed at Shakespeare.</p>



<p class="center p1"><i>The Hector of Germany, c. 1615</i></p>

<p><i>S. R.</i> 1615, April 24 (Buck). ‘A play called The Hector of

variant t.p.]</p>

<p><i>Edition</i> by L. W. Payne (1906, <i>Pennsylvania Univ. Publ.</i>).</p>

<p>The epistle says ‘I have begun in a former Play, called the Freemans
Honour, acted by the Now-Seruants of the Kings Maiestie, to
dignifie the worthy Companie of the Marchantaylors’. If the phrase
‘Now-Seruants’ implies production before 1603, the identification of W.
Smith and Wentworth Smith becomes very probable. The prologue explains
that the Palsgrave is not Frederick, since ‘Authorities sterne brow’
would not permit ‘To bring him while he lives upon the stage’, and
apologizes for the performance by ‘men of trade’.</p>

<p class="p-left p2">EDMUND SPENSER (1552–99).</p>

<p>The only record of Spenser’s dramatic experiments, unless they are
buried amongst the anonymous plays of the Revels Accounts, is to be
found in his correspondence of April 1580 with Gabriel Harvey, who
wrote, ‘I imagine your Magnificenza will hold us in suspense ... for
your nine English Commedies’, and again, ‘I am void of all judgment if
your Nine Comedies, whereunto in imitation of Herodotus, you give the
names of the Nine Muses (and in one mans fancy not unworthily) come
not nearer Ariosto’s Comedies, either for the fineness of plausible
elocution, or the rareness of Poetical Invention, than that Elvish
Queen doth to his Orlando Furioso’ (<i>Two other Very Commendable
Letters</i>, in Harvey’s <i>Works</i>, i. 67, 95). I can hardly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_495">[495]</span>
suppose that the manuscript play of ‘Farry Queen’ in Warburton’s list
(<i>3 Library</i>, ii. 232) had any connexion with Spenser’s comedies.</p>

<p>Derby seems to have had players from 1594 to 1618, who presumably
acted the comedies which he was said to be ‘penning’ in June 1599
(cf. ch. xiii), but none of these can be identified, although the
company’s anonymous <i>Trial of Chivalry</i> (1605) needs an author. A
fantastic theory that his plays were for the Chamberlain’s, and that
he wrote them under the name of William Shakespeare, was promulgated
by J. Greenstreet in <i>The Genealogist</i>, n.s. vii. 205; viii. 8,
137, and has been elaborately developed by A. Lefranc in <i>Sous le
Masque de ‘William Shakespeare’</i> (1919) and later papers in <i>Le
Flambeau</i> and elsewhere. <i>A Midsummer Night’s Dream</i> was not
impossibly written for his wedding on 26 Jan. 1595 (cf. App. A and

<p>Sir H. Wotton wrote to Sir Edmund Bacon (Wotton, ii. 13): ‘On Sunday
last at night, and no longer, some sixteen apprentices (of what sort
you shall guess by the rest of the story) having secretly learnt a
new play without book, intituled <i>The Hog hath lost his Pearl</i>,
took up the White-Fryers for their theatre: and having invited thither
(as it should seem) rather their mistresses than their masters; who
were all to enter <i>per bullettini</i> for a note of distinction from
ordinary comedians, towards the end of the play the sheriffs (who by
chance had heard of it) came in (as they say) and carried some six or
seven of them to perform the last act at Bridewel; the rest are fled.
Now it is strange to hear how sharp-witted the City is, for they will
needs have Sir John Swinerton, the Lord Mayor, be meant by the Hog,
and the late Lord Treasurer [Lord Salisbury] by the Pearl.’ Swinnerton
was Lord Mayor in 1612–13. The letter is only dated ‘Tuesday’, but
refers to the departure of the King, which was 22 Feb. 1613, as on the
previous day. This would give the first Sunday in Lent (21 Feb.) for
the date of production. The phrase (<span class="allsmcap">I.</span> i) ‘Shrove-Tuesday
is at hand’ suggests 14 Feb., but the date originally intended was
very likely altered. The Prologue refers to the difficulties of the
producers. The play had been ‘toss’d from one house to another’. It
does not grunt at ‘state-affairs’ or ‘city vices’. There had been
attempts to ‘prevent’ it, but it ‘hath a Knight’s license’, doubtless
Sir George Buck’s. In <span class="allsmcap">I.</span> i is some chaff, apparently directed
at Garlic and the Fortune, and an interview between a player and one
Haddit, who writes a jig called <i>Who Buys my Four Ropes of Hard
Onions</i> for four angels, and a promise of a box for a new play.
Fleay, ii. 256, identifies Haddit with Dekker, but his reasons do
not bear analysis, and Haddit is no professional playwright, but a
gallant who has run through his fortune. A passage in Act <span class="allsmcap">III</span>

Cecil.</p>

and a photographic facsimile by W. Young, <i>History of Dulwich</i>
(1889), ii. 5.</p>

<p>The ‘platt’ names a number of actors and may thereby be assigned
to a revival by the Admiral’s or Strange’s men about 1590 (cf. ch.
xiii). The play consisted of three episodes illustrating Envy, Sloth,
and Lechery, together with an Induction. This renders plausible the
conjecture of Fleay, 83, supported by Greg, <i>Henslowe</i>, ii. 153,
that it is the <i>Four Plays in One</i> revived by Strange’s for
Henslowe on 6 March 1592. And if so, the original two parts may be
traceable in the <i>Five Plays in One</i> and the <i>Three Plays in
One</i> of the Queen’s men in 1585. Tarlton was of course a Queen’s
man, and evidence of his authorship is furnished by Gabriel Harvey,
who in his <i>Four Letters</i> (1592, <i>Works</i>, i. 194) attacks
Nashe’s <i>Pierce Penilesse</i> (1592) as ‘not Dunsically botched-vp,
but right-formally conueied, according to the stile, and tenour of
Tarletons president, his famous play of the seauen Deadly sinnes;
which most deadly, but most liuely playe, I might haue seene in
London; and was verie gently inuited thereunto at Oxford by Tarleton
himselfe’. Nashe defends himself against the charge of plagiarism in
his <i>Strange News</i> (1592, <i>Works</i>, i. 304, 318), and confirms
the indication of authorship.</p>

<i>M. L. R.</i> iv. 517).</p>

<p>Winstanley (1687) assigned the play to Antony Brewer, but Sir J.
Harington, in a memorandum printed by F. J. Furnivall from <i>Addl.
MS.</i> 27632 in <i>7 N. Q.</i> ix. 382, notes ‘The combat of Lingua
made by Thom. Tomkis of Trinity colledge in Cambridge’, and this is
rendered plausible by the resemblance of the play to <i>Albumazar</i>.
It is clearly of an academic type. As to the date there is less
certainty. G. C. Moore Smith (<i>M. L. R.</i> iii. 146) supports 1602
by a theory that a compliment (<span class="allsmcap">IV.</span> vii) to Queen Psyche is
really meant for Elizabeth, and contains allusions to notable events of
her reign. I do not find his interpretations very convincing, although
I should not like to say that they are impossible. Fleay, ii. 261,
starting from a tradition handed down by the publisher of 1657 that
Oliver Cromwell acted in the play, conjectures that the play formed
part of Sir Oliver Cromwell’s entertainment of James at Hinchinbrook on
27–9 April 1603, and that his four-year-old nephew took the four-line
part of Small Beer (<i>IV.</i> v). Either date would fit in with the
remark in <i>III.</i> v, ‘About the year 1602 many used this skew kind
of language’. Boas, however, prefers a date near that of publication,
on account of similarities to passages in <i>Macbeth</i>. The play was
translated as <i>Speculum Aestheticum</i> for Maurice of Hesse-Cassel
in 1613 by Johannes Rhenanus, who probably accompanied Prince Otto to
England in 1611; cf. P. Losch, <i>Johannes Rhenanus</i> (1895).</p>

royal visit given by S. Pegge from Sir Edward Dering’s MS. in <i>Gent.

entry, ‘Given M<sup>r</sup>. Tomkis for his paines in penning and ordering the

adaptation of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_499">[499]</span> Giambattista Porta’s <i>L’Astrologo</i> (1606). No
importance is to be attached to the suggestion of H. I. in <i>3 N.
Q.</i> ix. 178, 259, 302, that Shakespeare was the author and wrote
manuscript notes in a copy possessed by H. I. Dryden regards the play
as the model of Jonson’s <i>Alchemist</i> (1610):</p>

<p>G. C. Moore Smith (<i>M. L. R.</i> iii. 149) supports the attribution

Affections</i> (1630), also called in a running title and in <i>Bodl.

<p>Tourneur, or Turnor, first appears as the author of a satire, <i>The
Transformed Metamorphosis</i> (1600), but his history and relationships
to the Cecils and to Sir Francis Vere suggest that he was connected
with a Richard Turnor who served in the Low Countries as water-bailiff
and afterwards Lieutenant of Brill during 1585–96. His career as a
dramatist was over by 1613, and from December of that year to his death
on 28 Feb. 1626 he seems himself to have been employed on foreign
service, mainly in the Low Countries but finally at Cadiz, where he was
secretary to the council of war under Sir Edward Cecil in 1625. He died
in Ireland and left a widow Mary.</p>

<p>The document appears to be a ‘bill’. It is 12¾ by 7¾ inches, and
contains a synopsis under nine heads, beginning with the civil wars
from Edward III to Mary ‘induct by shew and in Action’, and continuing
with episodes from the reign of Elizabeth, who is England’s Joy. In
sc. viii ‘a great triumph is made with fighting of twelue Gentlemen
at Barriers’, and in sc. ix Elizabeth ‘is taken vp into Heauen, when
presently appeares, a Throne of blessed Soules, and beneath vnder the
Stage set forth with strange fireworkes, diuers blacke and damned
Soules, wonderfully discribed in their seuerall torments’. Apart from
the bill, Vennar must have given it out that the performers were to be
amateurs. Chamberlain, 163, writes to Carleton on 19 Nov. 1602:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘And, now we are in mirth, I must not forget to tell you of
a cousening prancke of one Venner, of Lincolns Inne, that
gave out bills of a famous play on Satterday was sevenight
on the Banckeside, to be acted only by certain gentlemen
and gentlewomen of account. The price at cumming in was two
shillings or eighteen pence at least; and when he had gotten
most part of the mony into his hands, he wold have shewed them
a faire paire of heeles, but he was not so nimble to get up on
horse-backe, but that he was faine to forsake that course, and
betake himselfe to the water, where he was pursued and taken,
and brought before the Lord Chiefe Justice, who wold make
nothing of it but a jest and a merriment, and bounde him over
in five pound to appeare at the sessions. In the meane time
the common people, when they saw themselves deluded, revenged
themselves upon the hangings, curtains, chairs, stooles, walles,
and whatsoever came in theire way, very outragiously, and made
great spoile; there was great store of good companie, and many
noblemen.’</p>
</div>

<p class="p-left">Similarly John Manningham in his <i>Diary</i>, 82, 93,
notes in Nov. 1602, how</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="p-left">‘Vennar, a gent. of Lincolnes, who had lately playd a notable
cunni-catching tricke, and gulled many under couller of a play
to be of gent. and reuerens, comming to the court since in a
blacke suit, bootes and golden spurres without a rapier, one
told him he was not well suited; the golden spurres and his
brazen face uns[uited].’</p>
</div>

<p class="p-left">On 27 Nov. he adds, ‘When one said that Vennar the graund
connicatcher had golden spurres and a brazen face, “It seemes”, said R.
R. “he hath some mettall in him.”’ Vennar’s own account of ‘my publique
default of the Swan, where not a collier but cals his deere 12 pense to
witnesse the disaster of the day’ was given many years later in ‘<i>An
Apology</i>: Written by Richard Vennar, of Lincolnes Inne, abusively
called Englands Joy. 1614’, printed by Collier in <i>Illustrations</i>
(1866), iii. It vies in impudence with the original offence. He had
been in prison and was in debt, and ‘saw daily offering to the God of
pleasure, resident at the Globe on the Banke-side’. This suggested
his show, ‘for which they should give double payment, to the intent
onely, men of ability might make the purchase without repentance’. He
continues:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="p-left">‘My devise was all sorts of musique, beginning with chambers,
the harpe of war, and ending with hounds, the cry of peace, of
which I was doubly provided for Fox and Hare. The report of
gentlemen and gentlewomens<span class="pagenum" id="Page_502">[502]</span> actions, being indeed the flagge
to our theater, was not meerely falcification, for I had
divers Chorus to bee spoken by men of good birth, schollers by
profession, protesting that the businesse was meerely abused
by the comming of some beagles upon mee that were none of the
intended kennell: I meane baylifes, who, siezing mee before the
first entrance, spoke an Epilogue instead of a Prologue. This
changed the play into the hunting of the fox, which, that the
world may know for a verity, I heere promise the next tearme,
with the true history of my life, to bee publiquely presented,
to insert, in place of musicke for the actes, all those
intendments prepared for that daies enterteinment.’</p>
</div>

<p class="p-left">Later on he says, ‘I presented you with a dumbe show’,
and jests on getting ‘so much mony for six verses’, which, I suppose,
means that the performance was intended to be a spoken one, but was
broken off during the prologue. Apparently the new entertainment
contemplated by Vennar in 1614 was in fact given, not by him but by
William Fennor, to whom John Taylor writes in his <i>A Cast Over
Water</i> (1615):</p>

<p>Robin Goodfellow, in Jonson’s <i>Love Restored</i> (<i>1612</i>), calls
the absence of a mask ‘a fine trick, a piece of England’s Joy’, and
three characters in the <i>Masque of Augurs</i> (<i>1622</i>) are said
to be ‘three of those gentlewomen that should have acted in that famous
matter of England’s Joy in six hundred and three’&mdash;apparently a slip
of Jonson’s as to the exact date. Other allusions to the ‘gullery’ are
in Saville, <i>Entertainment of King James at Theobalds</i> (1603); R.
Brathwaite, <i>The Poet’s Palfrey</i> (<i>Strappado for the Devil</i>,
ed. J. W. Ebsworth, 160); J. Suckling, <i>The Goblins</i> (ed. Hazlitt,
ii. 52); W. Davenant, <i>Siege of Rhodes</i>, Pt. ii, prol. It may
be added that Vennar’s cozenage was perhaps suggested by traditional
stories of similar tricks. One is ascribed to one Qualitees in <i>Merry
Tales, Wittie Questions and Quick Answeres</i>, cxxxiii (1567, Hazlitt,
<i>Jest Books</i>, i. 145). In this bills were set up ‘vpon postes
aboute London’ for ‘an antycke plaie’ at Northumberland Place and
‘all they that shoulde playe therin were gentilmen’. Another is the
subject of one of the <i>Jests</i> of George Peele (Bullen, ii. 389).
W. Fennor, <i>The Compters Commonwealth</i> (1617),<span class="pagenum" id="Page_503">[503]</span> 64, tells of an
adventure of ‘one M<sup>r</sup>. Venard (that went by the name of Englands Joy)’

<p>Meres (1598) includes the earl in his list of ‘the best for Comedy

from 1580 to 1602 (cf. ch. xiii), little is known of their plays, and
none can be assigned to him, although the anonymous <i>The Weakest

England about 1608, and became a pirate in the Mediterranean, dying at
Messina on 6 Sept. 1615 (<i>Verney Memoirs<sup>2</sup></i>, i. 47). G. C. Moore

Carpenter dates the play <i>c.</i> 1550; but his chief argument that

<p>This translation is generally supposed to have influenced the <i>Comedy

<p class="p-left p2">THOMAS WATSON (<i>c.</i> 1557–92).</p>

<p>An Oxford man, who took no degree, and a lawyer, who did not practise,
Watson became an elegant writer of English and Latin verse. He won the
patronage of Walsingham at Paris in 1581, and became a member of the
literary circle of Lyly and Peele. His most important volume of verse
is the <i>Hekatompathia</i> (1582) dedicated to the Earl of Oxford. At
the time of his death in Sept. 1592 he was in the service of William
Cornwallis, who afterwards wrote to Heneage that he ‘could devise
twenty fictions and knaveryes in a play which was his daily practyse
and his living’ (<i>Athenaeum</i>, 23 Aug. 1890). This suggests that
the poet, and not the episcopal author of <i>Absalon</i> (<i>Mediaeval
Stage</i>, ii. 458), is the Watson included by Meres in 1598 amongst
our ‘best for Tragedie’. But his plays, other than translations, must,
if they exist, be sought amongst the anonymous work of 1581–92, where
it would be an interesting task to reconstruct his individuality. In
<i>Ulysses upon Ajax</i> (1596) Harington’s anonymous critic says of
his etymologies of Ajax, ‘Faith, they are trivial, the froth of witty
Tom Watson’s jests, I heard them in Paris fourteen years ago: besides
what balductum [trashy] play is not full of them’. In the meantime
Oliphant (<i>M. P.</i> viii. 437) has suggested that he may be the
author of <i>Thorny Abbey, or, The London Maid</i>, printed by one R.
D. with Haughton’s <i>Grim, the Collier of Croydon</i> in <i>Gratiae
Theatrales</i> (1662) and there assigned to T. W. Oliphant regards
<i>Thorny Abbey</i> as clearly a late revision of an Elizabethan play.</p>

<p class="p-left p2">JOHN WEBSTER (?-> 1634).</p>

<p>There is little clue to the personal history of John Webster beyond
the description of him on the title-page of his mayoral pageant
<i>Monuments of Honour</i> (1624) as ‘Merchant Taylor’, and his claim
in the epistle to have been born free of the company. The records of
the Merchant Taylors show that freemen of this name were admitted in
1571, 1576, and 1617, and that one of them was assessed towards the
coronation expenses in 1604. A John Webster, Merchant Taylor, also
received an acknowledgement of a 15<i>s.</i> debt from John and Edward
Alleyn on 25 July 1591 (Collier, <i>Alleyn Papers</i>, 14). A John
Webster married Isabel Sutton at St. Leonard’s Shoreditch on 25 July
1590, and had a daughter Alice baptized there on 9 May 1606. It has
been taken for granted that none of the sixteenth-century records
can relate to the dramatist, although they may to his father. This
presumably rests on the assumption that he must have been a young man
when he began to write for Henslowe in 1602. It should, however, be
pointed out that a John Webster, as well as a George Webster, appears
amongst the Anglo-German actors of Browne’s group in 1596 (cf. ch. xiv)
and that the financial record in the <i>Alleyn Papers</i> probably
belongs to a series of transactions concerning the winding up of a
theatrical company in which Browne and the Alleyns had been interested
(cf. ch. xiii, s.v. Admiral’s). It is conceivable therefore that
Webster was an older man than has been suspected and had had a career
as a player before he became a playwright.</p>

<p>Gildon, <i>Lives of the Poets</i> (1698), reports that Webster was
parish clerk of St Andrew’s, Holborn. This cannot be confirmed from
parish books, but may be true.</p>

<p>As a dramatist, Webster generally appears in collaboration, chiefly
with Dekker, and at rather infrequent intervals from 1602 up to 1624
or later. In 1602 he wrote commendatory verses for a translation by
Munday, and in 1612 for Heywood’s <i>Apology for Actors</i>. In 1613 he
published his elegy <i>A Monumental Column</i> on the death of Prince
Henry, and recorded his friendship with Chapman. His marked tendency to
borrow phrases from other writers helps to date his work. He can hardly
be identified with the illiterate clothworker of the same name, who
acknowledged his will with a mark on 5 Aug. 1625. But he is referred to
in the past in Heywood’s <i>Hierarchie of the Angels</i> (1635), Bk.
iv, p. 206, ‘Fletcher and Webster ... neither was but Iacke’, and was
probably therefore dead.</p>

<p>The play is in Beeston’s list of Cockpit plays in 1639 (<i>Var.</i>

Stoll, 197, who put the play 1623–39, because of resemblances to
<i>Julius Caesar</i> and <i>Coriolanus</i> which he thought implied
a knowledge of F<sub>1</sub>, traced a dependence upon the comic manner of
Heywood. Similarly, Sykes is puzzled by words which he thinks borrowed
from Heywood and first used by Heywood in works written after Webster’s
death. He comes to the conclusion that Heywood may have revised a late
work by Webster. There is much to be said for the view taken by Brooke
and Clark, after a thorough-going analysis of the problem, that the
play is Heywood’s own, possibly with a few touches from Webster’s hand,
and may have been written, at any date not long after the production of
<i>Coriolanus</i> on the stage (<i>c.</i> 1608), for Queen Anne’s men,
from whom it would naturally pass into the Cockpit repertory.</p>

<p>The epistle apologizes for the ill success of the play, on the ground
that ‘it was acted in so dull a time of winter, presented in so open
and blacke a theater, that it wanted ... a full and understanding
auditory’, and complains that the spectators at ‘that play-house’
care more for new plays than for good plays. Fleay, ii. 271, dates
the production in the winter of 1607–8, taking the French ambassador
described in <span class="allsmcap">III.</span> i. 73 as a performer ‘at last tilting’ to be
M. Goterant who tilted on 24 March 1607, since ‘no other Frenchman’s
name occurs in the tilt-lists. It is nothing to Fleay that Goterant
was not an ambassador, or that the lists of Jacobean tilters are
fragmentary, or that the scene of the play is not England but Italy.
Simpson found an inferior limit in a borrowing from Jonson’s <i>Mask
of Queens</i> on 2 Feb. 1609. I do not find much conviction in the
other indications of a date in 1610 cited by Sampson, xl, or in the
parallel with Jonson’s epistle to <i>Catiline</i> (1611), with which
Stoll, 21, supports a date in 1612. The Irish notes which Stoll regards
as taken from B. Rich,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_510">[510]</span> <i>A New Description of Ireland</i> (1610),
in fact go back to Stanyhurst’s account of 1577, and though there is
a pretty clear borrowing from Tourneur’s <i>Atheist’s Tragedy</i>,
that may have been produced some time before its publication in 1611.
Nor was Dekker necessarily referring to Webster, when he wrote to the
Queen’s men in his epistle before <i>If this be not a Good Play</i>
(1612): ‘I wish a <i>Faire</i> and <i>Fortunate Day</i> to your
<i>Next New-Play</i> for the <i>Makers-sake</i> and your <i>Owne</i>,
because such <i>Brave Triumphes</i> of <i>Poesie</i> and <i>Elaborate
Industry</i>, which my <i>Worthy Friends Muse</i> hath there set forth,
deserue a <i>Theater</i> full of very <i>Muses</i> themselves to be
<i>Spectators</i>. To that <i>Faire Day</i> I wish a <i>Full</i>,
<i>Free</i> and <i>Knowing Auditor</i>.’</p>

<p>Webster’s own epistle contains his appreciation ‘of other mens worthy
labours; especially of that full and haightned stile of Maister
<i>Chapman</i>, the labor’d and understanding workes of Maister
<i>Johnson</i>, the no lesse worthy composures of the both worthily
excellent Maister <i>Beamont</i>, &amp; Maister <i>Fletcher</i>, and lastly
(without wrong last to be named) the right happy and copious industry
of M. <i>Shakespeare</i>, M. <i>Decker</i>, &amp; M. <i>Heywood</i>’. In

approved industry of my friend Maister Perkins’.</p>

<p>The date of first production may reasonably be put in 1613–14. Crawford
has pointed out the resemblances between the play and <i>A Monumental

of the World</i> (1612), Chapman’s <i>Petrarch’s Seven Penitentiall

Lawrence thinks that Campion’s mask of 14 Feb. 1613 is also drawn upon.
But it is not impossible that the extant text has undergone revision,
in view of borrowings from the 6th edition (1615) of Sir Thomas
Overbury’s <i>Characters</i>, to which Sykes calls attention, and of
the apparent allusion pointed out by Vaughan in <span class="allsmcap">I.</span> i. 5 to the
purging of the French Court by Louis XIII after the assassination of
Marshall d’Ancre on 14 April 1617. It need not be inferred that this is
the ‘enterlude concerninge the late Marquesse d’Ancre’, which the Privy
Council ordered the Master of Revels to stay on 22 June 1617 (<i>M. S.
C.</i> i. 376).</p>

<p>In the epistle to <i>The Devil’s Law Case</i>, Webster says to Sir T.
Finch, ‘Some of my other works, as The White Devil, The Duchess of
Malfi, Guise and others, you have formerly seen’, and a <i>Guise</i> is
ascribed to him as a comedy in Archer’s play-list of 1656 and included
without ascription as a tragedy in Kirkman’s of 1661 and 1671 (Greg,
<i>Masques</i>, lxxii). Rogers and Ley’s list of 1656 had given it to
Marston (q.v.). Collier forged an entry in Henslowe’s diary meant to
suggest that this was the <i>Massacre at Paris</i> (cf. s.v. Marlowe).</p>

<p class="p-left p2">GEORGE WHETSTONE (1544?-87?).</p>

<p>Whetstone was a Londoner by origin. After a riotous youth, he turned to
literature interspersed with adventure, possibly acting at Canterbury
<i>c.</i> 1571 (cf. ch. xv), serving in the Low Countries in 1572–4,
the Newfoundland voyage in 1578–9, and the Low Countries again in
1585–6. His chief literary associates were Thomas Churchyard and George
Gascoigne.</p>

<p>After writing his one play, <i>Promos and Cassandra</i>, he translated
its source, the 5th Novel of the 8th Decade of Giraldi Cinthio’s
<i>Hecatomithi</i> (1565) in his <i>Heptameron of Civil Discourses</i>
(1582). Both Italian and English are in Hazlitt, <i>Shakespeare’s
Library</i> (1875, iii). Like some other dramatists, Whetstone turned
upon the stage, and attacked it in his <i>Touchstone for the Time</i>
(1584; cf. App. C, No. xxxvi).</p>

scenes. Whetstone’s epistle is of some critical interest (cf. App. C,
No. xix). In the <i>Heptameron</i> he says the play was ‘yet never
presented upon stage’. The character of the s.ds. suggests, however,
that it was written for presentation.</p>

<p>Lee (<i>D. N. B.</i>) after personally consulting the register of
St. Leonard’s Shoreditch, confirms the extract in Collier, iii. 348,
of the burial on 19 Aug. 1603 of ‘George Wilkins, the poet’. It must
therefore be assumed that the date of 9 Aug. 1613 given for the entry
by T. E. Tomlins in <i>Sh. Soc. Papers</i>, i. 34, from Ellis’s
<i>History of Shoreditch</i> (1798) is an error, and that the ‘poet’
was distinct from the dramatist. Nothing is known of Wilkins except
that he wrote pamphlets from <i>c.</i> 1604 to 1608, and towards the
end of that period was also engaged in play-writing both for the King’s
and the Queen’s men. A George Wilkins of St. Sepulchre’s, described
as a victualler and aged 36, was a fellow witness with Shakespeare in
<i>Belott v. Mountjoy</i> on 19 June 1612 (C. W. Wallace, <i>N. U.

<p>The play, which was based on the life of Walter Calverley, as given
in pamphlets of 1605, appears to have been still on the stage when
it was printed. An allusion in <span class="allsmcap">III.</span> ii to fighting with a
windmill implies some knowledge of Don Quixote, but of this there are
other traces by 1607. The Clown is called Robin in <span class="allsmcap">II.</span> ii, and

Decorum of These Days</i> (1918, <i>M. L. A.</i> xxxiii. 244).</p>

<p>The MSS. represent the play as originally produced, probably, from an
allusion in one of the sonnets, at Greenwich. The print represents a
later revision by Wilmot, involving much re-writing and the insertion
of new scenes and the dumb-shows. Webbe’s epistle is an encouragement
to Wilmot to publish his ‘waste papers’, and refers to <i>Tancred</i>
as ‘framed’ by the Inner Temple, and to Wilmot as ‘disrobing him of
his antique curiosity and adorning him with the approved guise of
our stateliest English terms’. Wilmot’s own Epistle to the Readers
apologizes for the indecorum of publishing a play, excuses it by the
example of Beza’s <i>Abraham</i> and Buchanan’s <i>Jephthes</i>, and
refers to ‘the love that hath been these twenty-four years betwixt’
himself and Gismund. This seems to date the original production in
1567. But I find no evidence that Elizabeth was at Greenwich in
1567. Shrovetide 1566 seems the nearest date at which a play is
likely to have been given there. Wilmot was clearly not the sole
author of the original play; to Act <span class="allsmcap">I</span> he affixes ‘<i>Exegit
Rod. Staff.</i>’; to Act <span class="allsmcap">II</span>, ‘<i>Per Hen. No.</i>’; to Act
<span class="allsmcap">III</span>, ‘<i>G. Al.</i>’; to Act <span class="allsmcap">IV</span>, ‘<i>Composuit Chr.
Hat.</i>’; to the Epilogue, ‘<i>R. W.</i>’ Probably Act <span class="allsmcap">V</span>,
which has no indication of authorship, was also his own.</p>

<p>W. H. Cooke, <i>Students Admitted to the Inner Temple, 1547–1660</i>
(1878), gives the admission of Christopher Hatton in 1559–60, but
Wilmot is not traceable in the list; nor are Hen. No., G. Al., or Rod.
Staff. But the first may be Elizabeth’s Gentleman Pensioner,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_515">[515]</span> Henry

<p>The stylistic resemblance of this to the next two plays justifies
the attribution to Wilson, although Hazlitt suggests Wilmot. Gosson
describes the play in 1582 (<i>P. C.</i> 185) together with a play in
answer called <i>London Against the Three Ladies</i>, but does not
indicate whether either play was then in print. In B ii Peter’s pence
are dated as ‘not muche more than 26 yeares, it was in Queen Maries
time’. As the Act reviving Peter’s pence was passed in the winter of
1554–5, the play was probably written in 1581.</p>

1601 to Chettle for <i>The Orphan’s Tragedy</i>, and (iii) of £2 to Day
in Jan. 1600 for an Italian tragedy. He supposes that (ii) and (iii)
were the same play, that it was finished, and that in 1601 Chettle
combined it with (i), possibly dropping out Day’s contributions to both
pieces. Yarington he dismisses as a scribe. In the alternate scenes
of the extant version he discerns distinct hands, presumably those of
Haughton and Chettle respectively. Law does not think that there are
necessarily two hands at all, finds imitation of <i>Leire</i> (1594)
in scenes belonging to both plots, and reinstates Yarington. Oliphant
(<i>M. P.</i> viii. 435) boldly conjectures that ‘Rob. Yarington’ might
be a misreading of ‘W<sup>m</sup> Haughton’. Bullen thought that this play,
<i>Arden of Feversham</i>, and <i>A Warning for Fair Women</i> might
all be by the same hand.</p>


<p class="p-left p2">CHRISTOPHER YELVERTON (<i>c.</i> 1535–1612).</p>

<p>Yelverton entered Gray’s Inn in 1552. He is mentioned as a poet in
Jasper Heywood’s verses before Thomas Newton’s translation (1560) of
Seneca’s <i>Thyestes</i>, and wrote an epilogue to the Gray’s Inn
<i>Jocasta</i> of Gascoigne (q.v.) and Kinwelmershe in 1566. He also
helped to devise the dumb-shows for the Gray’s Inn <i>Misfortunes of
Arthur</i> of Thomas Hughes (q.v.) on 28 Feb. 1588. He became a Justice
of the Queen’s Bench on 2 Feb. 1602 and was knighted on 23 July 1603.</p>

offen stat der weltlichkeit da man zu sicht, ubi fiunt chorei, ludi et
de alijs leutitatibus, sicut nos facimus oster spill’ (Herrmann, 300).
Leo Battista Alberti’s <i>De Re Edificatoria</i> was written about
1451 and printed in 1485. Vitruvius, <i>De Architectura</i>, v. 3–9,
deals with the theatre. The essential passage on the scene is v. 6, 8–9
‘Ipsae autem scenae suas habent rationes explicitas ita, uti mediae
valvae ornatus habeant aulae regiae, dextra ac sinistra hospitalia,
secundum autem spatia ad ornatus comparata, quae loca Graeci περιάκτους
dicunt ab eo, quod machinae sunt in his locis versatiles trigonoe
habentes singulares species ornationis, quae, cum aut fabularum
mutationes sunt futurae seu deorum adventus, cum tonitribus repentinis
[ea] versentur mutentque speciem ornationis in frontes. secundum ea
loca versurae sunt procurrentes, quae efficiunt una a foro, altera
a peregre aditus in scaenam. genera autem sunt scaenarum tria: unum
quod dicitur tragicum, alterum comicum, tertium satyricum. horum autem
ornatus sunt inter se dissimili disparique ratione, quod tragicae
deformantur columnis et fastigiis et signis reliquisque regalibus
rebus; comicae autem aedificiorum privatorum et maenianorum habent
speciem prospectusque fenestris dispositos imitatione, communium

montibus reliquisque agrestibus rebus in topeodis speciem deformati’;

era ornata delli sei quadri del Cesareo triumpho per man del singulare
Mantengha: li doi altri lati discontro erano con simili archi, ma de

window, and visitors outside. At the beginning, ‘Dalio commeth to the

hed in at the wyndowe, the Scenese commeth out’. The dialogue of sc. v
proceeds at the door, and finally ‘Dalio pulleth the Scenese in at the
dores’. In <i>Two Ital. Gent.</i> 435, ‘Victoria comes to the windowe,
and throwes out a letter’. It must not be assumed on the analogy of
later plays, and is in fact unlikely, that the windows of these early

Drummond, <i>Cypress Grove</i>, ‘Every one cometh there to act his part

followed by the drawing of curtains which are not front curtains.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_91" href="#FNanchor_91" class="label">[91]</a> Inns of Court and University plays naturally run on
analogous lines. For the ‘houses’ at Cambridge in 1564 and at Oxford in
1566, cf. ch. vii. The three Cambridge Latin comedies, <i>Hymenaeus</i>
(1579), <i>Victoria</i> (<i>c.</i> 1580–3), <i>Pedantius</i> (<i>c.</i>
1581), follow the Italian tradition. For <i>Victoria</i>, which has
the same plot as <i>Two Ital. Gent.</i>, Fraunce directs, ‘Quatuor
extruendae sunt domus, nimirum Fidelis, 1<sup>a</sup>, Fortunij, 2<sup>a</sup>, Cornelij,
3<sup>a</sup> Octauiani, 4<sup>a</sup>. Quin et sacellum quoddam erigendum est, in quo
constituendum est Cardinalis cuiusdam Sepulchrum, ita efformatum, vt
claudi aperirique possit. In Sacello autem Lampas ardens ponenda est’.
The earliest extant tragedies, Grimald’s <i>Christus Redivivus</i>
(<i>c.</i> 1540) and <i>Archipropheta</i> (<i>c.</i> 1547), antedate
the pseudo-Senecan influence. Practical convenience, rather than
dramatic theory, imposed upon the former a unity of action before the
tomb. Grimald says, ‘Loca item, haud usque eò discriminari censebat;
quin unum in proscenium, facilè &amp; citra negocium conduci queant’. The
latter was mainly before Herod’s palace, but seems to have showed
also John’s prison at Macherus. There is an opening scene, as in
<i>Promos and Cassandra</i>, of approach to the palace (Boas, 28, 35).
Christopherson’s <i>Jephthah</i>, Watson’s (?) <i>Absalon</i>, and
Gager’s <i>Meleager</i> (1582) observe classical unity. The latter has
two houses, in one of which an altar may have been ‘discovered’. Boas,
170, quotes two s.ds., ‘Transeunt venatores e Regia ad fanum Dianae’
and ‘Accendit ligna in ara, in remotiore scenae parte extructa’.
Gager’s later plays (Boas, 179) seem to be under the influence of
theatrical staging. On Legge’s <i>Richardus Tertius vide</i> p.
43, <i>infra</i>.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_92" href="#FNanchor_92" class="label">[92]</a> I do not suggest that the actual ‘templum’ in Serlio’s
design, which is painted on the back-cloth, was practicable. The
<i>ruffiana’s</i> house was. About the shop or tavern, half-way
up the rake of the stage, I am not sure. There is an echo of the

or Paul’s play; it was given before an audience who ‘sit and see’, and
to whom the presenters ‘cast comfets’ (39). The <i>domus</i> required
for a background are (<i>a</i>) Ralph’s, (<i>b</i>) Mars’s court,
(<i>c</i>) Venus’s court, (<i>d</i>) the Duke’s court, (<i>e</i>) the
cabin of Contempt. From (<i>a</i>) to (<i>b</i>) is ‘not farre hence’
(138) and ‘a flight shoot vp the hill’ (578); between are a wood and a
spot near Charon’s ferry. From (<i>b</i>) to (<i>c</i>) leads ‘Adowne
the hill’ (776). At the end (<i>e</i>) is burnt, and foreshortening
of space is suggested by the s.d. (1564), ‘Enter the Duke ... then
compasse the stage, from one part let a smoke arise: at which place
they all stay’. At the beginning (3) ‘on the stage Mercurie from one
end Ceres from another meete’. <i>Summer’s Last Will and Testament</i>,
which cannot be definitely assigned either to the Chapel or to Paul’s,
continues the manner of the old interlude; it has a stage (1570), but
the abstract action requires no setting beyond the tiled hall (205,
359, 932, 974) in which the performance was given. <i>The Wars of
Cyrus</i> is a Chapel play, but must be classed, from the point of view
of staging, with the plays given in public theatres (cf. p. 48).</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_115" href="#FNanchor_115" class="label">[115]</a> Gibson had used written titles to name his pageant
buildings; cf. Brewer, ii. 1501; Halle, i. 40, 54. The Westminster
accounts <i>c.</i> 1566 (cf. ch. xii) include an item for ‘drawing the
tytle of the comedee’. The Revels officers paid ‘for the garnyshinge
of xiiij titles’ in 1579–80, and for the ‘painting of ix. titles
with copartmentes’ in 1580–1 (Feuillerat, <i>Eliz.</i> 328, 338).
The latter number agrees with that of the plays and tilt challenges
for the year; the former is above that of the nine plays recorded,
and Lawrence thinks that the balance was for locality-titles. But
titles were also sometimes used in the course of action. Thus <i>Tide
Tarrieth for No Man</i> has the s.d. (1439), ‘Christianity must
enter with a sword, with a title of pollicy, but on the other syde of
the tytle, must be written gods word, also a shield, wheron must be
written riches, but on the other syde of the shield must be Fayth’.
Later on (1501) Faithful ‘turneth the titles’. Prologues, such as
those of <i>Damon and Pythias</i>, <i>Respublica</i>, and <i>Conflict
of Conscience</i>, which announce the names of the plays, tell rather
against the use of title-boards for those plays. For the possible use
of both title- and scene-boards at a later date, cf. pp. 126, 154.</p>

constitutes a fresh scene, or the divisions of the editors, who often
assume a change of locality where none has taken place; cf. ch. xxii.
I do not regard a scene as broken by a momentary clearance of the
stage, or by the opening of a recess in the background while speakers
remain on the stage, or by the transference of action from one point
to another of the background if this transference merely represents a
journey over a foreshortened distance between neighbouring houses.</p>

<p class="p-left">The Gunner bids the Boy watch, and tell him if he sees
any English. Then ‘Enter Salisbury and Talbot on the turrets, with
others’, and later ‘Enter the Boy with a Linstock’. The English talk
of attacking ‘heere, at the bulwarke of the bridge’, and ‘Here they
shot, and Salisbury falls downe’. After an <i>Exeunt</i> which clears
the stage, there is fighting in the open, during which a French
relieving party ‘enter the Towne with souldiers’, and later ‘Enter
on the Walls, Puzel, Dolphin, Reigneir, Alanson, and Souldiers’. In
<span class="allsmcap">II.</span> i, which follows, a French watch is set, lest English
come ‘neere to the walles’. Then ‘Enter Talbot, Bedford, and Burgundy,
with scaling Ladders’; Bedford will go ‘to yond corner’, Burgundy ‘to
this’, and Talbot mount ‘heere’. They assault, and ‘The French leape
ore the walles in their shirts. Enter seuerall wayes, Bastard, Alanson,
Reignier, halfe ready, and halfe unready’. They discourse and are
pursued by the English, who then ‘retreat’, and in turn discourse ‘here
... in the market-place’, rejoicing at how the French did ‘Leape o’re
the Walls for refuge in the field’. Then, after a clearance, comes a
scene at the Countess of Auvergne’s castle. In <span class="allsmcap">III.</span> ii the
Pucell enters before the gates of Rouen, obtains access by a trick, and
then ‘Enter Pucell on the top, thrusting out a torch burning’. Other
French watch without for the signal from ‘yonder tower’ or ‘turret’,
and then follow into the town and expel the English, after which,
‘Enter Talbot and Burgonie without: within, Pucell, Charles, Bastard,
and Reigneir on the walls’. After parley, ‘Exeunt from the walls’, and
fighting in front leaves the English victorious, and again able to
enter the town. In <span class="allsmcap">IV.</span> ii ‘Enter Talbot ... before Burdeaux’,
summons the French general ‘vnto the Wall’, and ‘Enter Generall aloft’.
In <span class="allsmcap">V.</span> iii the English are victorious before Angiers, sound for

to ‘yonder emptie seate’ (1408), and presently Marius is called up and
(1484) ‘He takes his seate’. In <span class="allsmcap">V.</span> v. 2231 ‘Scilla seated in

A.</i> <span class="allsmcap">I.</span> i, ‘Enter the Tribunes and Senatours aloft: and then
enter Saturninus and his followers at one doore, and Bassianus and his
followers’. Saturninus bids the tribunes ‘open the gates and let me in’
(63) and ‘They goe vp into the Senate house’. Titus enters and buries
his sons in his family tomb, and (299) ‘Enter aloft the Emperour’ and
speaks to Titus. There is a Venetian senate house in <i>K. to K. an
Honest Man</i>, scc. iii, xvii, but I do not find a similar interplay
with the outside citizens here.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_173" href="#FNanchor_173" class="label">[173]</a> Perhaps the best example is in <i>Arden of

the murderers in <span class="allsmcap">II.</span> ii. 189:</p>

  <div class="poetry-container1">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">

        <div>But on your left hand shall you see the staires</div>
        <div>That leads directly to my M. Chamber.</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

<p>Here, then, is <span class="allsmcap">III.</span> i. Arden and Francklin talk and go to bed.
Michael, in remorse, alarms them with an outcry, and when they appear,
explains that he ‘fell asleepe, Vpon the thresholde leaning to the
staires’ and had a bad dream. Arden then finds that ‘the dores were all
unlockt’. Later (<span class="allsmcap">III.</span> iv. 8) Michael lies about this to the
murderers:</p>

  <div class="poetry-container1">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div class="i5h">Francklin and my master</div>

        <div>And Francklin left his napkin where he sat</div>

        <div>Being in bed, he did bethinke himselfe,</div>
        <div>And comming down he found the dores vnshut:</div>
        <div>He lockt the gates, and brought away the keyes.</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

<p>When the murderers come in <span class="allsmcap">III.</span> ii, Will bids Shakebag ‘show
me to this house’, and Shakebag says ‘This is the doore; but soft,
me thinks tis shut’. They are therefore at the outer door of the
courtyard; cf. p. 69, n. 2. Similarly <i>1 Rich. II</i>, <span class="allsmcap">III.</span>
ii, which begins with ‘Enter Woodstock, Lancaster, and Yorke, at
Plashey’, and ‘heere at Plasshy house I’le bid you wellcome’, is
clearly in a courtyard. A servant says (114), ‘Ther’s a horseman at the
gate.... He will not off an’s horse-backe till the inner gate be open’.
Gloucester bids ‘open the inner gate ... lett hime in’, and (s.d.)
‘Enter a spruce Courtier a horse-backe’. It is also before the house,
for the Courtier says, ‘Is he within’, and ‘I’le in and speake with the
duke’. Rather more difficult is <i>Englishmen for my Money</i>, sc.
iv, ‘Enter Pisaro’ with others, and says, ‘Proud am I that my roofe
containes such friends’ (748), also ‘I would not haue you fall out in
my house’ (895). He sends his daughters ‘in’ (827, 851), so must be in
the porch, and a ‘knock within’ (s.d.) and ‘Stirre and see who knocks!’
(796) suggest a courtyard gate. But later in the play (cf. p. 58, n. 4)
the street seems to be directly before the same house.</p>

certain prisoners ‘in the vpper loft’. Presently she enters ‘with the
keyes’ and after the s.d. ‘Here open the doore’ calls them out and
gives them a signet to pass ‘the Porter of the gates’, which Servio
(1143) calls ‘my castell gates’. In <i>1 Hen. VI</i>, <span class="allsmcap">II.</span>
iii, the Countess of Auvergne, to entrap Talbot, bids her porter
‘bring the keyes to me’; presumably Talbot’s men are supposed to break
in the gates at the s.d. ‘a Peale of Ordnance’. <i>Rich. III</i>,
<span class="allsmcap">III.</span> vii, is at Baynard’s Castle. Buckingham bids Gloucester
(55) ‘get you vp to the leads’ to receive the Mayor, who enters with
citizens, and (95) ‘Enter Richard with two bishops a lofte’. Similarly
in <i>Rich. II</i>, <span class="allsmcap">III.</span> iii. 62, ‘Richard appeareth on
the walls’ of Flint Castle, and then comes down (178) to the ‘base
court’. <i>B. Beggar of Alexandria</i>, sc. ii, is before the house of
Elimine’s father and ‘Enter Elimine above on the walls’. She is in a

‘Enter the Moore and two murdrers bringing in his unkle Abdelmunen,
then they draw the curtains and smoother the yong princes in the bed.
Which done in sight of the vnkle they strangle him in his Chaire,
and then goe forth’; <i>Edw. I</i>, sc. xxv. 2668, ‘Elinor in

‘<i>Prince</i> [who has re-entered]. I came into your Chamber ...
And after that, seeing the Crowne, I tooke it’ ... (87) ‘Draw the
Curtaines, depart my Chamber, ... Exeunt omnes, The King dieth’. In
the analogous <i>2 Hen. IV</i>, <span class="allsmcap">IV.</span> iv, v (a continuous scene
divided, with unanimity in ill-doing, by modern editors in the middle
of a speech), the King says (<span class="allsmcap">IV.</span> iv. 131), ‘Beare me hence
Into some other chamber’, Warwick (<span class="allsmcap">IV.</span> v. 4), ‘Call for
the Musick in the other Roome’, and the King ‘Set me the Crowne
vpon my Pillow here’. The Prince enters and the Lords go to ‘the
other roome’; he takes the crown and ‘Exit’. Later (56) the
Lords say, ‘This doore is open, he is gone this way’, and ‘He
came not through the chamber where we staide’. The Prince returns
and the Lords are bidden ‘Depart the chamber’. Later (233) the
King asks the name of ‘the lodging where I first did swound’, and bids
‘beare me to that Chamber’. Then the scene, and in F<sub>1</sub> the act, ends.
In <i>1 Contention</i>, sc. x. 1, ‘Then the Curtaines being drawne,
Duke <i>Humphrey</i> is discouered in his bed, and two men lying on
his brest and smothering him in his bed. And then enter the Duke of
<i>Suffolke</i> to them’. He bids ‘draw the Curtaines againe and get
you gone’. The King enters and bids him call Gloucester. He goes out,
and returns to say that Gloucester is dead. Warwick says, ‘Enter his
priuie chamber my Lord and view the bodie’, and (50), ‘<i>Warwicke</i>
drawes the curtaines and showes Duke <i>Humphrey</i> in his bed’. The
analogous <i>2 Hen. VI</i>, <span class="allsmcap">III.</span> ii, omits the murder <i>coram
populo</i> and begins ‘Enter two or three running ouer the Stage, from
the Murther of Duke Humfrey’. It then follows the earlier model until
(132) the King bids Warwick ‘Enter his Chamber’ and we get the brief
s.d. (146) ‘Bed put forth’, and Warwick speaks again. The next scene
is another death scene, which begins in <i>1 Contention</i>, sc. xi,
‘Enter King and <i>Salsbury</i>, and then the Curtaines be drawne,
and the Cardinal is discouered in his bed, rauing and staring as if
he were madde’, and in <i>2 Hen. VI</i>, <span class="allsmcap">III.</span> iii, ‘Enter
the King ... to the Cardinal in bed’, ending (32) ‘Close vp his eyes,
and draw the Curtaine close’. In <i>1 Rich. II</i>, <span class="allsmcap">V.</span> i,
Lapoole enters ‘with a light’ and murderers, whom he bids ‘stay in the
next with-draweing chamber ther’. Then (48), ‘He drawes the curtayne’,
says of Gloucester ‘He sleepes vppon his bed’, and Exit. Gloucester,
awaked by ghosts, says (110), ‘The doores are all made fast ... and
nothing heere appeeres, But the vast circute of this emptie roome’.
Lapoole, returning, says, ‘Hee’s ryssen from his bed’. Gloucester bids
him ‘shutt to the doores’ and ‘sits to wright’. The murderers enter
and kill him. Lapoole bids ‘lay hime in his bed’ and ‘shutt the doore,
as if he ther had dyd’, and they (247) ‘Exeunt with the bodye’. In
<i>Death of R. Hood</i>, ii, ind., the presenter says ‘Draw but that
vaile, And there King John sits sleeping in his chaire’, and the s.d.
follows, ‘Drawe the curten: the King sits sleeping ... Enter Queene
... She ascends, and seeing no motion, she fetcheth her children one
by one; but seeing yet no motion, she descendeth, wringing her hands,
and departeth’. In <i>R. J.</i> <span class="allsmcap">IV.</span> iii, iv, v (continuous
action), Juliet drinks her potion and Q<sub>1</sub>, has the s.d. (<span class="allsmcap">IV.</span>
iii. 58) ‘She fals vpon her bed within the Curtaines’. Action follows
before the house, until the Nurse, bidden to call Juliet, finds her
dead. Then successively ‘Enter’ Lady Capulet, Capulet, the Friar, and
Paris, to all of whom Juliet is visible. After lament, the Friar, in
Q<sub>2</sub> (<span class="allsmcap">IV.</span> v. 91), bids them all ‘go you in’, but in Q<sub>1</sub>,
‘They all but the Nurse goe foorth, casting Rosemary on her and
shutting the Curtens’. The Nurse, then, in both texts, addresses the
musicians, who came with Paris. On the difficulty of this scene, in
relation to <span class="allsmcap">II.</span> ii and <span class="allsmcap">III.</span> v, cf. p. 94.</p>

‘Enter old <i>Marius</i> with his keeper, and two souldiers’. There is
(965) ‘this homely bed’, on which (972) ‘He lies downe’ (s.d.), and
when freed (1066) ‘from walls to woods I wend’. In <i>Edw. II</i>,
2448–2568 (at Kenilworth), keepers say that the King is ‘in a vault
vp to the knees in water’, of which (2455) ‘I opened but the doore’.
Then (2474) ‘Heere is the keyes, this is the lake’ and (2486), ‘Heeres
a light to go into the dungeon’. Then (2490) Edward speaks and,
presumably having been brought out, is bid (2520) ‘lie on this bed’.
He is murdered with a table and featherbed brought from ‘the next
roome’ (2478), and the body borne out. In <i>1 Tr. Raigne</i>, sc.
xii, Hubert enters, bids his men (8) ‘stay within that entry’ and when
called set Arthur ‘in this chayre’. He then bids Arthur (13) ‘take
the benefice of the faire evening’, and ‘Enter Arthur’ who is later
(131) bid ‘Goe in with me’. <i>K. J.</i> <span class="allsmcap">IV.</span> i has precisely
analogous indications, except that the attendants stand (2) ‘within
the arras’, until Hubert stamps ‘Vpon the bosome of the ground’. In
<i>Rich. III</i>, <span class="allsmcap">I.</span> iv, Clarence talks with his keeper, and
sleeps. Murderers enter, to whom the keeper says (97), ‘Here are the
keies, there sits the Duke a sleepe’. They stab him, threaten to ‘chop
him in the malmsey but in the next roome’ (161, 277), and bear the
body out. In <i>Rich. II</i>, <span class="allsmcap">V.</span> v (at Pontefract) Richard
muses on ‘this prison where I liue’. He is visited by a groom of his
stable (70), ‘where no man neuer comes, but that sad dog, That brings
me foode’. Then (95) ‘Enter one to Richard with meate’ and (105) ‘The
murderers rush in’, and (119) the bodies are cleared away. <i>Sir T.

<p class="p-left">In <i>Old Fortunatus</i>, 2572, Montrose says of Ampedo, ‘Drag him to
yonder towre, there shackle him’. Later (2608) Andelocia is brought to
join him in ‘this prison’ and the attendants bid ‘lift in his legs’.
The brothers converse in ‘fetters’. In <i>1 Oldcastle</i>, <span class="allsmcap">IV.</span>
iv, v (a continuous scene), ‘Enter the Bishop of Rochester with his
men, in liuerie coates’. They have brought him ‘heere into the Tower’
(1965) and may ‘go backe vnto the Porters Lodge’ or attend him ‘here
without’. But they slip away. The Bishop calls the Lieutenant and
demands to see Oldcastle. A message is sent to Oldcastle by Harpoole.
Then (1995), ‘Enter sir Iohn Oldcastle’, and while the Bishop dismisses
the Lieutenant, Harpoole communicates a plot ‘aside’ to Oldcastle.
Then the Bishop addresses Oldcastle, and as they talk Oldcastle and
Harpoole lay hands upon him. They take his upper garments, which
Oldcastle puts on. Harpoole says (2016) ‘the window that goes out into
the leads is sure enough’ and he will ‘conuay him after, and bind him
surely in the inner room’. Then (2023) ‘Enter seruing men againe’.
Oldcastle, disguised as the Bishop, comes towards them, saying, ‘The
inner roomes be very hot and close’. Harpoole tells him that he will
‘downe vpon them’. He then pretends to attack him. The serving-men
join in, and (2049) ‘Sir John escapes’. The Lieutenant enters and asks
who is brawling ‘so neare vnto the entrance of the Tower’. Then (2057)
‘Rochester calls within’, and as they go in and bring him out bound,
Harpoole gets away; cf. p. 62, n. 2. <i>Look About You</i>, sc. v, is a
similar scene in the Fleet, partly in Gloucester’s chamber (811), the
door of which can be shut, partly (865) on a bowling green. Analogous
to some of the prison scenes is <i>Alarum for London</i>, sc. xii, in
which a Burgher’s Wife shows Van End a vault where her wealth is hid,
and (1310) ‘She pushes him downe’, and he is stoned there.</p>

says (603) ‘weele to my studie straight’, and <span class="allsmcap">II.</span> iii begins
(616), ‘<i>Bacon</i> and <i>Edward</i> goes into the study’, where
Edward *sits and looks in ‘this glasse prospectiue’ (620), but his
vision is represented on some part of the stage; in <span class="allsmcap">IV.</span> i.
1530, ‘Enter Frier <i>Bacon</i> drawing the courtaines, with a white
sticke, a booke in his hand, and a lampe lighted by him, and the brazen
head and <i>Miles</i>, with weapons by him’. Miles is bid watch the
head, and ‘Draw closse the courtaines’ and ‘Here he [Bacon] falleth
asleepe’ (1568). Miles ‘will set me downe by a post’ (1577). Presently
(1604), ‘Heere the Head speakes and a lightning flasheth forth, and a
hand appeares that breaketh down the Head with a hammer’. Miles calls
to Bacon (1607) ‘Out of your bed’; <span class="allsmcap">IV.</span> iii. 1744 begins ‘Enter
frier <i>Bacon</i> with frier <i>Bungay</i> to his cell’. A woodcut
in Q<sub>2</sub> of 1630, after the revival by the Palsgrave’s men, seems to
illustrate <span class="allsmcap">II.</span> iii; the back wall has a window to the left and
the head on a bracket in the centre; before it is the glass on a table,
with Edward gazing in it; Bacon sits to the right. Miles stands to the
left; no side-walls are visible. In <i>Locrine</i>, <span class="allsmcap">I.</span> iii.
309, ‘Enter Strumbo aboue in a gowne, with inke and paper in his hand’;
<i>Dr. Faustus</i>, ind. 28, ‘And this the man that in his study sits’,

crownes and rich apparell to Faustus, and daunce, and then depart’,
with probably other scenes. In <i>T. A.</i> <span class="allsmcap">V.</span> ii. 1, ‘Enter
Tamora, and her two sonnes disguised’ ... (9) ‘They knocke and Titus
opens his studie doore’. Tamora twice (33, 43) bids him ‘come downe’,
and (80) says, ‘See heere he comes’. The killing of Tamora’s sons
follows, after which Titus bids (205) ‘bring them in’. In <i>Sir T.
More</i>, sc. viii. 735, ‘A table beeing couered with a greene Carpet,
a state Cushion on it, and the Pursse and Mace lying thereon Enter Sir
Thomas Moore’.... (765) ‘Enter Surrey, Erasmus and attendants’. Erasmus
says (779), ‘Is yond Sir Thomas?’ and Surrey (784), ‘That Studie is the
generall watche of England’. The original text is imperfect, but in the
revision Erasmus is bid ‘sitt’, and later More bids him ‘in’ (ed. Greg,
pp. 84, 86). <i>Lord Cromwell</i> has three studies; in <span class="allsmcap">II.</span>
i, ii (continuous action at Antwerp), ‘Cromwell in his study with
bagges of money before him casting of account’, while Bagot enters in
front, soliloquizes, and then (<span class="allsmcap">II.</span> ii. 23) with ‘See where
he is’ addresses Cromwell; in <span class="allsmcap">III.</span> ii (Bologna), the action
begins as a hall scene, for (15) ‘They haue begirt you round about
the house’ and (47) ‘Cromwell shuts the dore’ (s.d.), but there is an
inner room, for (115) ‘Hodge [disguised as the Earl of Bedford] sits in
the study, and Cromwell calls in the States’, and (126) ‘Goe draw the
curtaines, let vs see the Earle’; in <span class="allsmcap">IV.</span> v (London), ‘Enter
Gardiner in his studie, and his man’. <i>E. M. I.</i> <span class="allsmcap">I.</span>
iii, is before Cob’s house, and Tib is bid show Matheo ‘vp to Signior
Bobadilla’ (Q<sub>1</sub> 392). In <span class="allsmcap">I.</span> iv ‘Bobadilla discouers himselfe
on a bench; to him, Tib’. She announces ‘a gentleman below’; Matheo
is bid ‘come vp’, enters from ‘within’, and admires the ‘lodging’. In
<i>1 Oldcastle</i>, <span class="allsmcap">V.</span> i. 2086, ‘Enter Cambridge, Scroope,
and Gray, as in a chamber, and set downe at a table, consulting about
their treason: King Harry and Suffolke listning at the doore’ ...
(2114) ‘They rise from the table, and the King steps in to them, with
his Lordes’. <i>Stukeley</i>, i. 121, begins with Old Stukeley leaving
his host’s door to visit his son. He says (149), ‘I’ll to the Temple
to see my son’, and presumably crosses the stage during his speech of
171–86, which ends ‘But soft this is his chamber as I take it’. Then
‘He knocks’, and after parley with a page, says, ‘Give me the key of
his study’ and ‘methinks the door stands open’, enters, criticizes the
contents of the study, emerges, and (237) *‘Old Stukeley goes again to
the study’. Then (244) ‘Enter <i>Stukeley</i> at the further end of
the stage’ and joins his father. Finally the boy is bid (335) ‘lock
the door’. In <i>Downfall of R. Hood</i>, ind., ‘Enter Sir John Eltham
and knocke at Skeltons doore’. He says, ‘Howe, maister Skelton, what
at studie hard?’ and (s.d.) ‘Opens the doore’. In <i>2 Edw. IV</i>,
<span class="allsmcap">IV.</span> ii, ‘Enter D. Shaw, pensiuely reading on his booke’. He is
visited by a Ghost, who gives him a task, and adds, ‘That done, return;

Counting-house, with heapes of gold before him’. Later his house is
taken for a nunnery; he has hid treasure (536) ‘underneath the plancke
That runs along the vpper chamber floore’, and Abigail becomes a nun,
and (658) throws the treasure from ‘aboue’. He gets another house, and
Pilia-Borza describes (iii. 1167) how ‘I chanc’d to cast mine eye vp
to the Iewes counting-house’, saw money-bags, and climbed up and stole
by night. <i>Arden of Feversham</i>, <span class="allsmcap">I.</span>, <span class="allsmcap">III.</span> v,
<span class="allsmcap">IV.</span> i, <span class="allsmcap">V.</span> i are at Arden’s house at Feversham. From
<span class="allsmcap">I.</span> I should assume a porch before the house, where Arden and
his wife breakfast and (369) ‘Then she throwes down the broth on the
grounde’; cf. 55, ‘Call her foorth’, and 637, ‘Lets in’. It can hardly
be a hall scene, as part of the continuous action is ‘neare’ the house
(318) and at 245 we get ‘This is the painters [Clarke’s] house’, who is
called out. There is no difficulty in <span class="allsmcap">III.</span> v or <span class="allsmcap">IV.</span>
i; cf. <span class="allsmcap">III.</span> v. 164, ‘let vs in’. But <span class="allsmcap">V.</span> i, taken by
itself, reads like a hall scene with a counting-house behind. Black
Will and Shakebag are hidden in a ‘counting-house’, which has a ‘door’
and a ‘key’ (113, 145, 153). A chair and stool are to be ready for
Mosbie and Arden (130). Alice bids Michael (169) ‘Fetch in the tables,
And when thou hast done, stand before the counting-house doore’, and
(179) ‘When my husband is come in, lock the streete doore’. When Arden
comes with Mosbie, they are (229) ‘in my house’. They play at tables
and the murderers creep out and kill Arden, and (261), ‘Then they
lay the body in the Counting-house’. Susan says (267), ‘The blood
cleaueth to the ground’, and Mosbie bids (275) ‘strew rushes on it’.
Presently, when guests have come and gone, (342) ‘Then they open the
counting-house doore and looke vppon Arden’, and (363) ‘Then they beare
the body into the fields’. Francklin enters, having found the body,
with rushes in its shoe, ‘Which argueth he was murthred in this roome’,
and looking about ‘this chamber’, they find blood ‘in the place where
he was wont to sit’ (411–15).</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_195" href="#FNanchor_195" class="label">[195]</a> In <i>1 Hen. IV</i>, <span class="allsmcap">II.</span> iv, Henry calls Poins
(1) ‘out of that fat roome’ and bids him (32) ‘Stand in some by-roome’
while the Prince talks to the Drawer. The Vintner (91) bids the Drawer
look to guests ‘within’, and says Falstaff is ‘at the doore’. He enters
and later goes out to dismiss a court messenger who is (317) ‘at doore’
and returns. He has a chair and cushion (416). When the Sheriff comes,
Henry bids Falstaff (549) ‘hide thee behind the Arras, the rest walke
vp aboue’. Later (578) Falstaff is found ‘a sleepe behind the Arras’.
This looks like a hall scene, and with it <span class="allsmcap">III.</span> iii, where
Mrs. Quickly is miscalled (72) ‘in mine owne house’ and Falstaff says
(112) ‘I fell a sleepe here, behind the Arras’, is consistent. But in
<i>2 Hen. IV</i>, <span class="allsmcap">II.</span> iv, Falstaff and Doll come out of their
supper room. The Drawer announces (75) ‘Antient Pistol’s belowe’, and
is bid (109) ‘call him vp’ and (202) ‘thrust him downe staires’. Later
(381) ‘Peyto knockes at doore’; so does Bardolph (397), to announce
that ‘a dozen captaines stay at doore’. This is clearly an upper
parlour. In <i>Look About You</i>, scc. ix, x (continuous action),
Gloucester, disguised as Faukenbridge, and a Pursuivant have stepped
into the Salutation tavern (1470), and are in ‘the Bel, our roome next
the Barre’ (1639), with a stool (1504) and fire (1520). But at 1525 the
action shifts. Skink enters, apparently in a room called the Crown, and
asks whether Faukenbridge was ‘below’ (1533). Presumably he descends,
for (1578) he sends the sheriff’s party ‘vp them stayres’ to the Crown.
This part of the action is before the inn, rather than in the Bell.
<i>Humorous Day’s Mirth</i>, scc. viii, x-xii, in Verone’s ordinary,
with tables and a court cupboard, seems to be a hall scene; at viii.
254 ‘convey them into the inward parlour by the inward room’ does not
entail any action within the supposed inward room.</p>

p. 66), the king is in a chair behind a curtain, and the fact that
the queen ‘ascends’ and ‘descends’ may suggest that this chair is
the ‘state’. However this may be, I do not see how any space behind
the curtain can have been high enough to allow any dignity to the
elaborate states required by some court scenes; cf. p. 64, n. 5. The
throne imagined in the <i>Wagner Book</i> (cf. p. 72) had 22 steps.

of the passages quoted above, the black-hung stage is a metaphor for
night, but I agree with Lawrence that black hangings cannot well have
been used in the theatre to indicate night scenes as well as tragedy.
I do not know why he suggests that a ‘prevalent idea that the stage
was hung with blue for comedies’, for which, if it exists, there is
certainly no evidence, is ‘due to a curious surmise of Malone’s’.
Malone (<i>Var.</i> iii. 108) only suggests that ‘pieces of drapery
tinged with blue’ may have been ‘suspended across the stage to
represent the heavens’&mdash;quite a different thing. But, of course, there
is no evidence for that either. According to Reich, <i>Der Mimus</i>,

Archer (<i>Quarterly Review</i>, ccviii. 454) says, ‘In over a hundred
plays which we have minutely examined (including all Shakespeare’s
tragedies) there is only a small minority of cases in which explicit
provision is not made, either by stage-direction or by a line in the
text, for the removal of bodies. The few exceptions to this rule are
clearly mere inadvertences, or else are due to the fact that there is
a crowd of people on the stage in whose exit a body can be dragged or
carried off almost unobserved’. In <i>Old Fortunatus</i>, 1206, after
his sons have lamented over their dead father, ‘They both fall asleepe:
Fortune and a companie of Satyres enter with Musicke, and playing about
Fortunatus body, take him away’. Of course, a body left dead in the
alcove need not be removed; the closing curtains cover it.</p>

has promised to give before the Court, and alludes (184) to ‘a wondrous
shew besides. That I will haue there behinde a curtaine’. The actual
performance occupies part of <span class="allsmcap">IV.</span> iii, iv (a continuous scene).
In <span class="allsmcap">IV.</span> iii. 1, ‘Enter Hieronimo; he knocks up the curtaine’.
We must not be misled by the modern French practice of knocking for the
rise of the front curtain. The tragedy has not yet begun, and this is
no front curtain, but the curtain already referred to in <span class="allsmcap">IV.</span>
i, which Hieronimo is now hammering up to conceal the dead body of
Horatio, as part of the setting which he is arranging at one end of the
main stage. The Duke of Castile now enters, and it is clear that the
Court audience are to sit ‘above’, for Hieronimo begs the Duke (12)
that ‘when the traine are past into the gallerie, You would vouchsafe
to throw me downe the key’. He then bids (16) a Servant ‘Bring a
chaire and a cushion for the King’ and ‘hang up the Title: Our scene
is Rhodes’. We are still concerned with Court customs, and no light is
thrown on the possible use of title-boards on the public stage (cf. p.
126). The royal train take their places, and the performance is given.
Hieronimo epilogizes and suddenly (<span class="allsmcap">IV.</span> iv. 88) ‘Shewes his
dead sonne’. Now it is clear why he wanted the key of the gallery, for
(152) ‘He runs to hange himselfe’, and (157) ‘They breake in, and hold
Hieronimo’.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_287" href="#FNanchor_287" class="label">[287]</a> In <i>R. J.</i> <span class="allsmcap">II.</span> ii Romeo is in the orchard,
and (2) ‘But soft, what light through yonder window breaks?’ The
lovers discourse, he below, she ‘o’er my head’ (27). Presently (F<sub>1</sub>;
Q<sub>1</sub>, is summary here) Juliet says ‘I hear some noise within’ (136),
followed by s.d. ‘Cals within’ and a little later ‘Within: Madam’,
twice. Juliet then ‘Exit’ (155), and (159) ‘Enter Juliet again’.
Modern editors have reshuffled the s.ds. In <span class="allsmcap">III.</span> v, Q<sub>2</sub>
(reproduced in F<sub>1</sub>), in addition to textual differences from Q<sub>1</sub>,
may represent a revised handling of the scene. Q<sub>1</sub> begins ‘Enter
Romeo and Juliet at the window’. They discuss the dawn. Then ‘He goeth
downe’, speaks from below, and ‘Exit’. Then ‘Enter Nurse hastely’ and
says ‘Your Mother’s comming to your Chamber’. Then ‘She goeth downe
from the Window’. I take this to refer to Juliet, and to close the
action above, at a point represented by <span class="allsmcap">III.</span> v. 64 of the
modern text. Then follow ‘Enter Juliets Mother, Nurse’ and a dialogue
below. Q<sub>2</sub> begins ‘Enter Romeo and Juliet aloft’. Presently (36)
‘Enter Madame [? an error] and Nurse’, and the warning is given while
Romeo is still above. Juliet says (41) ‘Then, window, let day in, and
let life out’, and Romeo, ‘I’ll descend’. After his ‘Exit’ comes ‘Enter
Mother’ (64), and pretty clearly discourses with Juliet, not below, but
in her chamber. Otherwise there would be no meaning in Juliet’s ‘Is she
not downe so late or vp so early? What vnaccustomd cause procures her
hither?’ Probably, although there is no s.d., they descend (125) to
meet Capulet, for at the end of the scene Juliet bids the Nurse (231)
‘Go in’, and herself ‘Exit’ to visit Friar Laurence.</p>

Pollard stresses the difficulty of obtaining the hands of six Privy

quorum of that body, which sat several times a week, while many of its
members resided in court, were available for signing documents daily,
and did in fact sign, in sixes, many, such as warrants to the Treasurer
of the Chamber, of no greater moment than licences (cf. ch. ii). The
signatures were of course ministerial, and would be given to a licence
on the report of an expert reader. In any case the <i>Injunction</i>

It is possible that the wardens, intent on finance, did not always
transcribe into their accounts notes of authorizations. Only half a
dozen of the above are ascribed to the archbishop, yet a mention of
‘one Talbot, servant of the archbishop of Canterbury, a corrector
to the printers’ in an examination relative to the Ridolfi plot
(Haynes-Murdin, ii. 30) shows that he had enough work in 1571 to

<p><a id="Footnote_546" href="#FNanchor_546" class="label">[546]</a> Lambe notes (iii. 690) in 1636 that on 30 June 1588,
‘the archbishop gave power to Doctor Cosin, Doctor Stallard, Doctor
Wood, master Hartwell, master Gravett, master Crowley, master Cotton,
and master Hutchinson, or any one of them, to license books to be
printed: Or any 2 of those following master Judson, master Trippe,
master Cole and master Dickens’. It will be observed that most of
the first group of these had already acted as ‘correctors’, together
with William Redman and Richard Vaughan, chaplains respectively to
Archbishop Grindal and Bishop Aylmer. William Hutchinson and George
Dickens were also chaplains to Aylmer. Hutchinson was in the High
Commission of 1601. Richard Cosin was Dean of the Arches and a High
Commissioner. Abraham Hartwell was secretary and Cole chaplain (Arber,
ii. 494) to Archbishop Whitgift. Hutchinson, William Gravett, William
Cotton, and George Dickins were or became prebendaries of St. Paul’s.
Thomas Stallard was rector of All Hallows’ and St. Mary’s at Hill;
Henry Tripp of St. Faith’s and St. Stephen’s, Walbrook. Most of this
information is from Hennessy. Crowley was presumably Robert Crowley,
vicar of St. Giles, Cripplegate, and himself a stationer, although his
activity as a Puritan preacher and pamphleteer makes his appointment an
odd one for Whitgift. Moreover, he died on 18 June 1588. There may have
been two Robert Crowleys, or the archbishop’s list may have been drawn
up earlier than Lambe dates it.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_547" href="#FNanchor_547" class="label">[547]</a> Amongst the correctors who appear later in the Register
are Richard Bancroft, John Buckeridge, and Michael Murgatroyd,
secretaries or chaplains to Whitgift, Samuel Harsnett, William Barlow,
Thomas Mountford, John Flower, and Zacharias Pasfield, prebendaries of
St. Paul’s, William Dix, Peter Lyly, chaplain of the Savoy and brother
of the dramatist, Lewis Wager, rector of St. James’s, Garlickhithe, and
dramatist, John Wilson, and Gervas Nidd. Mountford and Dix were in the
High Commission of 1601. I have not troubled to trace the full careers
of these men in Hennessy and elsewhere. Thomas Morley (Arber, iii. 93)
and William Clowes (ii. 80) seem to have been applied to as specialists
on musical and medical books respectively.</p>

other trifles escape with 4<i>d.</i> Payments were sometimes in arrear;
often there is no note of fee to a title; and in some of these cases
the words ‘neuer printed’ have been added. On the other hand, the
receipt of fees is sometimes recorded, and the title remains unentered;
at the end of the entries for 1585–6 (ii. 448) is a memorandum that one
of the wardens ‘brought in about iiij<sup>s</sup> moore which he had receved for

<p><a id="Footnote_585" href="#FNanchor_585" class="label">[585]</a> <i>Conflict of Conscience</i>; cf. <i>Damon and

‘is somewhat altered for the proper use of them that hereafter shall
haue occasion to plaie it, either in Priuate, or open Audience’.
The castings, for four, five, or six players, occur in <i>King
Darius</i>, <i>Like Will to Like</i>, <i>Longer Thou Livest</i>,
<i>Mary Magdalen</i>, <i>New Custom</i>, <i>Tide Tarrieth for No
Man</i>, <i>Trial of Treasure</i>, <i>Conflict of Conscience</i>. I
find a later example from the public stage in <i>Fair Maid of the
Exchange</i>, which has ‘Eleauen may easily acte this comedie’, and a
division of parts accordingly. There are pre-Elizabethan precedents,
while <i>Jack Juggler</i> is ‘for Chyldren to playe’, the songs in
<i>Ralph Roister Doister</i> are for ‘those which shall vse this
Comedie or Enterlude’, and <i>The Four Elements</i> has directions
for reducing the time of playing at need from an hour and a half to
three-quarters of an hour, and the note ‘Also yf ye lyst ye may brynge
in a dysgysynge’. Similarly <i>Robin Hood</i> is ‘for to be played in
Maye games’. That books were in fact bought to act from is shown by
entries in the accounts of Holy Trinity, Bungay, for 1558 of 4<i>d.</i>
for ‘the interlude and game booke’ and 2<i>s.</i> for ‘writing the

headed ‘Praie for all estates’). <i>Mary Magdalen</i> and <i>Tide
Tarrieth for No Man</i> substitute a mere expression of piety. I do
not agree with Fleay, 57, that such prayers are evidence of Court
performance. The reverence and epilogue to the Queen in the belated
moral of <i>Liberality and Prodigality</i> (1602), 1314, is different
in tone. <i>The Pedlar’s Prophecy</i>, also belated as regards date
of print, adds to the usual prayer for Queen and council ‘And that
honorable T. N. &amp;c. of N. chiefly: Whom as our good Lord and maister,
found we haue’. No doubt any strolling company purchasing the play
would fill up the blanks to meet their own case. Probably both the
Queen and estates and the ‘lord’ of a company were prayed for, whether
present or absent, so long as the custom lasted; cf. ch. x, p. 311; ch.

been printed earlier. The Chapel boys seem to have revived one at least
of Lyly’s old Paul’s plays in 1601. The Chamberlain’s adopted <i>Titus
Andronicus</i>, which had been Sussex’s, and Shakespeare revised for
them <i>Taming of A Shrew</i> and <i>The Contention</i>, which had
been Pembroke’s, and based plays which were new from the literary, and
in the case of the last also from the publisher’s, standpoint on the

<p><a id="Footnote_604" href="#FNanchor_604" class="label">[604]</a> Pollard, <i>Sh. F.</i> 48; <i>F. and Q.</i> 64. More
recently A. W. Pollard and J. D. Wilson have developed a theory
(<i>T. L. S.</i> Jan.–Aug. 1919) that the ‘bad quartos’ rest upon
pre-Shakespearian texts partly revised by Shakespeare, of which
shortened transcripts had been made for a travelling company in 1593,
and which had been roughly adapted by an actor-reporter so as to bring
them into line with the later Shakespearian texts current at the time
of publication. Full discussion of this theory belongs to a study of
Shakespeare. The detailed application of it in J. D. Wilson, <i>The
Copy for Hamlet 1603 and the Hamlet Transcript 1593</i> (1918), does
not convince me that Shakespeare had touched the play in 1593, although
I think that the reporter was in a position to make some slight use of
a pre-Shakespearian <i>Hamlet</i>. And although travelling companies
were doubtless smaller than the largest London companies (cf. chh. xi
and xiii, s.v. Pembroke’s), there is no external evidence that special
‘books’ were prepared for travelling. For another criticism of the
theory, cf. W. J. Lawrence in <i>T. L. S.</i> for 21 Aug. 1919. Causes
other than travelling might explain the shortening of play texts:
prolixity, even in an experienced dramatist (cf. t.p. of <i>Duchess of
Malfi</i>), the approach of winter afternoons, an increased popular
demand for jigs.</p>

in such Bookes as are Registred by them at their Hall, in their several
Names: and are secured in taking the ful benefit of those books, better

<p><a id="Footnote_606" href="#FNanchor_606" class="label">[606]</a> Pollard, <i>F. and Q.</i> 10. Mr. Pollard seems to
suggest (<i>F. and Q.</i> 3) that copyright in a printed book did not
hold as against the author. He cites the case of Nashe’s <i>Pierce
Pennilesse</i>, but there seems no special reason to assume that in
this case, or in those of <i>Gorboduc</i> and <i>Hamlet</i>, the
authorized second editions were not made possible by an arrangement,
very likely involving blackmail, with the pirate.</p>

surely there was no copyright, as neither Danter nor Burby paid for an
entry. I take it that when, on 22 Jan. 1607, <i>R. J.</i> and <i>L. L.

consent of Master Burby in wrytinge’, the entry of the transfer secured

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
